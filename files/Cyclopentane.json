{"name":"Cyclopentane","desc":"Cyclopentane is a highly flammable alicyclic hydrocarbon with chemical formula C5H10 and CAS number 287-92-3, consisting of a ring of five carbon atoms each bonded with two hydrogen atoms above and below the plane. It occurs as a colorless liquid with a petrol-like odor. Its melting point is −94 °C and its boiling point is 49 °C. Cyclopentane is in the class of cycloalkanes, being alkanes that have one or more rings of carbon atoms.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Cyclopentane2d.png/100px-Cyclopentane2d.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cyclopentane","":"","IUPAC name":"Cyclopentane","Other names":"pentamethylene","CAS Number":"287-92-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:23492 Y","ChemSpider":"8896 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.470","EC Number":"206-016-6","PubChem CID":"9253","RTECS number":"GY2390000","Chemical formula":"C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>","Molar mass":"70.1 g/mol","Appearance":"clear, colorless liquid","Odor":"mild, sweet","Density":"0.751 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−93.9 °C (−137.0 °F; 179.2 K)","Boiling point":"49.2 °C (120.6 °F; 322.3 K)","Solubility in water":"156 mg·l−1 (25 °C)[1]","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, acetone, ether","Vapor pressure":"400 mmHg (31 °C)[2]","Acidity (pKa)":"~45","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-59.18·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4065","Main hazards":"Flammable[2]","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"−37.2 °C (−35.0 °F; 236.0 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"361 °C (682 °F; 634 K)","Explosive limits":"1.1%-8.7%[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 600 ppm (1720 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[2]","Related compounds":"cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclohexane","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
