{"name":"Calcium hydroxide","desc":"Calcium hydroxide (traditionally called slaked lime) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(OH)2. It is a colorless crystal or white powder and is obtained when calcium oxide (called lime or quicklime) is mixed, or slaked with water. It has many names including hydrated lime, caustic lime, builders' lime, slack lime, cal, or pickling lime. Calcium hydroxide is used in many applications, including food preparation. Limewater is the common name for a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Calcium_hydroxide.jpg/200px-Calcium_hydroxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Mg(OH)2Xray.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg/200px-Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Calcium hydroxide","Other names":"Slaked lime\nMilk of lime\nCalcium(II) hydroxide\nPickling lime\nHydrated lime\nPortlandite\nCalcium hydrate\n\n\n\n\nSlaked lime\nMilk of lime\nCalcium(II) hydroxide\nPickling lime\nHydrated lime\nPortlandite\nCalcium hydrate","CAS Number":"1305-62-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:31341 Y","ChemSpider":"14094 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.762","EC Number":"215-137-3","E number":"E526 (acidity regulators, ...)","Gmelin Reference":"846915","KEGG":"D01083 Y","PubChem CID":"14777","RTECS number":"EW2800000","UNII":"PF5DZW74VN Y","Chemical formula":"Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"74.093 g/mol","Appearance":"White powder","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"2.211<span class=\"nowrap\">&#xA0;</span>g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"580 °C (1,076 °F; 853 K) (loses water, decomposes)","Solubility in water":"1.89 g/L (0 °C)\n1.73 g/L (20 °C)\n0.66 g/L (100 °C)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"5.5×10−6","Solubility":"Soluble in glycerol and acids.\nInsoluble in alcohol.","Basicity (pKb)":"1.37 (first OH−), 2.43 (second OH−)[1][2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−22.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.574","Crystal structure":"Hexagonal, hP3[3]","Space group":"P3m1 No. 164","Lattice constant":"a = 0.35853 nm, c = 0.4895 nm","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"83 J·mol−1·K−1[4]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−987 kJ·mol−1[4]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\n[5]","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22, R34","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S24","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"7340 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n7300 mg/kg (mouse)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (total) 5 mg/m3 (resp.)[6]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 5 mg/m3[6]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[6]","Other cations":"Magnesium hydroxide\nStrontium hydroxide\nBarium hydroxide","Related bases":"Calcium oxide","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
