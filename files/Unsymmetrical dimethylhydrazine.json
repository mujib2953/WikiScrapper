{"name":"Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine","desc":"Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; 1,1-dimethylhydrazine) is a chemical compound with the formula H2NN(CH3)2. It is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammoniacal smell typical for organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It mixes completely with water, ethanol, and kerosene. In concentration between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (CH3NHNH(CH3)) is also known but is not as useful.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine with some implicit hydrogens shown","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/1%2C1-Dimethylhydrazin2.svg/100px-1%2C1-Dimethylhydrazin2.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/1%2C1-dimethylhydrazine-3D-balls.png/100px-1%2C1-dimethylhydrazine-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/UDMH","IUPAC name[1]":"1,1-dimethylhydrazine[1]","Other names":"Dimazine","CAS Number":"57-14-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"605261","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18853 N","ChemSpider":"5756 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.287","EC Number":"200-316-0","KEGG":"C19233 Y","MeSH":"dimazine","PubChem CID":"5976","RTECS number":"MV2450000","UN number":"1163","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"60.10 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Ammoniacal, fishy","Density":"791&#xA0;kg m<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (at 22&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−57 °C; −71 °F; 216 K","Boiling point":"64.0 °C; 147.1 °F; 337.1 K","Solubility in water":"miscible[2]","Vapor pressure":"13.7 kPa (at 20 °C)","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4075","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"164.05 J K−1 mol−1","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"200.25 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"48.3 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−1982.3–−1975.1 kJ mol−1","Main hazards":"carcinogen, spontaneously ignites on contact with oxidizers","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H301, H314, H331, H350, H411","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P261, P273, P280, P301+310","NFPA 704":"3\n4\n1","Flash point":"−10 °C (14 °F; 263 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"248 °C (478 °F; 521 K)","Explosive limits":"2–95%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"122 mg kg−1 (oral, rat)\n1.06 g kg−1 (dermal, rabbit)","LC50 (median concentration)":"252 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n172 ppm (mouse, 4 hr)\n392 ppm (hamster, 4 hr)\n3580 ppm (dog, 15 min)\n1410 ppm (rat, 1 hr)\n981 ppm (dog, 1 hr)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.5 ppm (1 mg/m3) [skin][2]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca C 0.06 ppm (0.15 mg/m3) [2-hr][2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [15 ppm][2]","Related compounds":"Dimethylamine\nhydrazine\nSymmetrical dimethylhydrazine","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
