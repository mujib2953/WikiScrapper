{"name":"Sodium selenate","desc":"Sodium selenate is the inorganic compound with the formula Na\n2SeO\n4, not to be confused with sodium selenite. It exists as the anhydrous salt, the heptahydrate, and the decahydrate. These are white, water-soluble solids. The decahydrate is a common ingredient in multivitamins and livestock feed as a source of selenium. The anhydrous salt is used in the production of some glass. Although the selenates are much more toxic, many physical properties of sodium selenate and sodium sulfate are similar.","images":[{"alt":"Natriumselenat.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Natriumselenat.svg/200px-Natriumselenat.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_selenate","IUPAC name":"Sodium selenate","CAS Number":"10102-23-5 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:77775 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.169","EC Number":"236-501-8","PubChem CID":"25960","UNII":"0CJN4029EB N","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Sodium\">Na</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Selenium\">Se</span>","Molar mass":"188.95 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White or grey powder","Density":"3.098 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Solubility in water":"soluble","ATC code":"A12CE01 (WHO)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Toxic (T)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R23/25, R33, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S20/21, S28, S45, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Sodium sulfate","Other cations":"Potassium selenate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
