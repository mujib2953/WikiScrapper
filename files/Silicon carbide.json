{"name":"Silicon carbide","desc":"Silicon carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum /kɑːrbəˈrʌndəm/, is a compound of silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.","images":[{"alt":"Sample of silicon carbide as a boule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/SiC_p1390066.jpg/244px-SiC_p1390066.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Silicon_carbide","Preferred IUPAC name":"Silicon carbide\nSilicon carbide","Other names":"Carborundum\nMoissanite","CAS Number":"409-21-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29390 Y","ChemSpider":"9479 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.006.357","EC Number":"206-991-8","Gmelin Reference":"13642","MeSH":"Silicon+carbide","PubChem CID":"9863","RTECS number":"VW0450000","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><span title=\"Silicon\">Si</span>","Molar mass":"40.10 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Yellow to green to bluish-black, iridescent crystals[1]","Density":"3.16 g&#xB7;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (hex.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-b92_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-b92-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"2,830 °C (5,130 °F; 3,100 K)[2] (decomposes)","Electron mobility":"~900 cm2/V·s (all polytypes)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−12.8·10−6 cm3/mol[3]","Refractive index (nD)":"2.55 (infrared; all polytypes)[4]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
