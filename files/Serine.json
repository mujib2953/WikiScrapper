{"name":"Serine","desc":"Serine (abbreviated as Ser or S) encoded by the codons UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU and AGC is an ɑ-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+\n3 form under biological conditions), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form in physiological conditions), and a side chain consisting of a hydroxymethyl group (see hydroxyl), classifying it as a polar amino acid. It can be synthesized in the human body under normal physiological circumstances, making it a nonessential amino acid.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/L-Serin_-_L-Serine.svg/100px-L-Serin_-_L-Serine.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Serine","":"","IUPAC name":"Serine","Other names":"2-Amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid","CAS Number":"56-45-1 (L-) Y\n302-84-1 (DL-) Y\n312-84-5 (D-) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17115 Y","ChemSpider":"5736 (L-form) Y\n597 Y","DrugBank":"DB00133 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.250","EC Number":"206-130-6","IUPHAR/BPS":"726","PubChem CID":"617","UNII":"452VLY9402 (L-) Y\n00PAR1C66F (DL-) N\n1K77H2Z9B1 (D-) N","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"105.09 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white crystals or powder","Density":"1.603 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (22&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"246 °C (475 °F; 519 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"soluble","Acidity (pKa)":"2.21 (carboxyl), 9.15 (amino)[1]","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
