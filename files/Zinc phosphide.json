{"name":"Zinc phosphide","desc":"Zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) is an inorganic chemical compound. It is a grey solid, although commercial samples are often dark or even black. It is used as a rodenticide. Zn3P2 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.5 eV. and may have applications in photovoltaic cells. A second zinc phosphide is known, with the stoichiometry ZnP2.","images":[{"alt":"Zinc phosphide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Zn3P2structure.jpg/200px-Zn3P2structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_phosphide","Other names":"trizinc diphosphide","CAS Number":"1314-84-7 (Zn\n2P\n3) N\n12037-79-5 (ZnP\n2) N\n51810-70-9 (Zn\nxP\nx) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"11344765 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.859","UNII":"813396S1PC Y","Chemical formula":"Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"258.12 g/mol","Appearance":"gray tetragonal crystals","Density":"4.55 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,160 °C (2,120 °F; 1,430 K)","Solubility in water":"reacts","Solubility":"insoluble in ethanol, soluble in benzene, reacts with acids","Crystal structure":"Tetragonal, tP40","Space group":"P42/nmc, No. 137","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
