{"name":"Ammonium nitrate","desc":"Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation. It has the chemical formula NH4NO3, simplified to N2H4O3. It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction. It is the major constituent of ANFO, a popular industrial explosive which accounts for 80% of explosives used in North America; similar formulations have been used in improvised explosive devices. Many countries are phasing out its use in consumer applications due to concerns over its potential for misuse.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Ammonium-nitrate-2D.svg/200px-Ammonium-nitrate-2D.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ammonium nitrate crystal structure","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Ammonium-nitrate-xtal-3D-balls-A.png/200px-Ammonium-nitrate-xtal-3D-balls-A.png"},{"alt":"Sample of white powder","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Ammonium_Nitrate.jpg/200px-Ammonium_Nitrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate","IUPAC name":"Ammonium nitrate","CAS Number":"6484-52-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"21511 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.026.680","RTECS number":"BR9050000","UNII":"T8YA51M7Y6 Y","UN number":"0222 – with > 0.2% combustible substances\n1942 – with <= 0.2% combustible substances\n2067 – fertilizers\n2426 – liquid","Chemical formula":"NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"80.043 g/mol","Appearance":"white/grey solid","Density":"1.725 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"169.6 °C (337.3 °F; 442.8 K)","Boiling point":"approx. 210 °C; decomposes","Solubility in water":"118 g/100 ml (0 °C)\n150 g/100 ml (20 °C)\n297 g/100 ml (40 °C)\n410 g/100 ml (60 °C)\n576 g/100 ml (80 °C)\n1024 g/100 ml (100 °C)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-33.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"trigonal","Shock sensitivity":"very low","Friction sensitivity":"very low","Detonation velocity":"5270 m/s","Main hazards":"Explosive","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0216","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"E (E)","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n3\nOX","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2085–5300 mg/kg (oral in rats, mice)[2]","Other anions":"Ammonium nitrite","Other cations":"Sodium nitrate\nPotassium nitrate\nHydroxylammonium nitrate","Related compounds":"Ammonium perchlorate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
