{"name":"Zinc selenide","desc":"Zinc selenide (ZnSe) is a light-yellow, solid compound comprising zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se). It is an intrinsic semiconductor with a band gap of about 2.70 eV at 25 °C (77 °F). ZnSe rarely occurs in nature, and is found in the mineral that was named after Hans Stille called \"stilleite.\"","images":[{"alt":"Zinc selenide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Zinc-selenide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Zinc-selenide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"ZnSe.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/ZnSe.jpg/200px-ZnSe.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_selenide","Stilleite":"Zinc selenide\nStilleite","CAS Number":"1315-09-9 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.873","PubChem CID":"4298215","Chemical formula":"ZnSe","Molar mass":"144.35 g/mol","Appearance":"light yellow solid","Density":"5.27 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,525 °C (2,777 °F)","Solubility in water":"negligible","Band gap":"2.82 eV (10 K)","Refractive index (nD)":"2.67 (550 nm)\n2.40 (10.6 µm)","Crystal structure":"Zincblende (cubic)","Lattice constant":"a = 566.8 pm","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (Zn2+)\nTetrahedral (Se2−)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−177.6 kJ/mol","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Toxic (T)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R23/25, R33, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S20/21, S28, S45, S60, S61","Other anions":"Zinc oxide\nZinc sulfide\nZinc telluride","Other cations":"Cadmium selenide\nMercury selenide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
