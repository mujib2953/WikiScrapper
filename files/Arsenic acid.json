{"name":"Arsenic acid","desc":"Arsenic acid is the chemical compound with the formula H3AsO4. More descriptively written as AsO(OH)3, this colorless acid is the arsenic analogue of phosphoric acid. Arsenate and phosphate salts behave very similarly. Arsenic acid as such has not been isolated, but only found in solution where it is largely ionized. Its hemihydrate form (H3AsO4· 1⁄2H2O) does form stable crystals. Crystalline samples dehydrate with condensation at 100 °C.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Arsenate.svg/150px-Arsenate.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Arsenic-acid-3D-balls.png/150px-Arsenic-acid-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Arsenic_acid","IUPAC name":"Arsenic acid, arsoric acid","Other names":"Arsenic acid\nOrthoarsenic acid\nDesiccant L-10\nZotox","CAS Number":"7778-39-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18231 Y","ChemSpider":"229 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.001","EC Number":"231-901-9","KEGG":"C01478 Y","RTECS number":"CG0700000","UNII":"N7CIZ75ZPN Y","Chemical formula":"H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"141.94 g/mol","Appearance":"White translucent crystals,\nhygroscopic.","Density":"2.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"35.5 °C (95.9 °F; 308.6 K)","Boiling point":"120 °C (248 °F; 393 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"16.7 g/100 mL","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol","Vapor pressure":"55 hPa (50 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"2.19, 6.94, 11.5","Molecular shape":"Tetrahedral","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Toxic (T)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R23/25, R45, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"S53, S45, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"48 mg/kg (rat, oral)","Other anions":"Phosphoric acid","Other cations":"Sodium arsenate","Related compounds":"Arsenous acid\nArsenic pentoxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
