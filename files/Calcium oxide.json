{"name":"Calcium oxide","desc":"Calcium oxide (CaO), commonly known as quicklime or burnt lime, is a widely used chemical compound. It is a white, caustic, alkaline, crystalline solid at room temperature. The broadly used term lime connotes calcium-containing inorganic materials, in which carbonates, oxides and hydroxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, aluminium, and iron predominate. By contrast, quicklime specifically applies to the single chemical compound calcium oxide. Calcium oxide that survives processing without reacting in building products such as cement is called free lime.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Calcium-oxide-3D-vdW.png/200px-Calcium-oxide-3D-vdW.png"},{"alt":"Calcium oxide powder.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Calcium_oxide_powder.JPG/200px-Calcium_oxide_powder.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Quicklime","IUPAC name":"Calcium oxide","Other names":"Quicklime, burnt lime, unslaked lime, pebble lime, calcia","CAS Number":"1305-78-8","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:31344","ChemSpider":"14095","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.763","E number":"E529 (acidity regulators, ...)","Gmelin Reference":"485425","PubChem CID":"14778","RTECS number":"EW3100000","UNII":"C7X2M0VVNH","UN number":"1910","Chemical formula":"CaO","Molar mass":"56.0774 g/mol","Appearance":"White to pale yellow/brown powder","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"3.34<span class=\"nowrap\">&#xA0;</span>g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"2,613 °C (4,735 °F; 2,886 K)[1]","Boiling point":"2,850 °C (5,160 °F; 3,120 K) (100 hPa)[2]","Solubility in water":"Reacts to form calcium hydroxide","Solubility in Methanol":"Insoluble (also in diethyl ether, n-octanol)","Acidity (pKa)":"12.8","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−15.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Cubic, cF8","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"40 J·mol−1·K−1[3]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−635 kJ·mol−1[3]","ATCvet code":"QP53AX18 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"Hazard.com","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2","Flash point":"Non-flammable  [4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5 mg/m3[4]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 2 mg/m3[4]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"25 mg/m3[4]","Other anions":"Calcium sulfide\nCalcium hydroxide","Other cations":"Beryllium oxide\nMagnesium oxide\nStrontium oxide\nBarium oxide"}
