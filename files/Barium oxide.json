{"name":"Barium oxide","desc":"Barium oxide, BaO, is a white hygroscopic non-flammable compound. It has a cubic structure and is used in cathode ray tubes, crown glass, and catalysts. It is harmful to human skin and if swallowed in large quantity causes irritation. Excessive quantities of barium oxide may lead to death.","images":[{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"},{"alt":"Barium oxide.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Barium_oxide.JPG/200px-Barium_oxide.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_oxide","Other names":"Barium monoxide\nBarium protoxide\nCalcined baryta\nBaria","CAS Number":"1304-28-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56180 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.753","PubChem CID":"62392","RTECS number":"CQ9800000","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Barium\">Ba</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"153.326 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"5.72 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"1,923 °C (3,493 °F; 2,196 K)","Boiling point":"~ 2,000 °C (3,630 °F; 2,270 K)","Solubility in water":"3.48 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n90.8 g/100 mL (100 °C)\nReacts to form Ba(OH)2","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, dilute mineral acids and alkalies; insoluble in acetone and liquid ammonia","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-29.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic, cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"70 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−582 kJ·mol−1[2]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Xn","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/22","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S28","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Barium hydroxide\nBarium peroxide","Other cations":"Calcium oxide\nStrontium oxide","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
