{"name":"Copper(II) acetate","desc":"Copper(II) acetate, also referred to as cupric acetate, is the chemical compound with the formula Cu(OAc)2 where AcO− is acetate (CH\n3CO−\n2). The hydrated derivative, which contains one molecule of water for each Cu atom, is available commercially. Anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 is a dark green crystalline solid, whereas Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is more bluish-green. Since ancient times, copper acetates of some form have been used as fungicides and green pigments. Today, copper acetates are used as reagents for the synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds. Copper acetate, like all copper compounds, emits a blue-green glow in a flame.","images":[{"alt":"Copper(II)-acetate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Copper%28II%29-acetate.jpg/200px-Copper%28II%29-acetate.jpg"},{"alt":"Copper(II)acetate crystal 01.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Copper%28II%29acetate_crystal_01.jpg/200px-Copper%28II%29acetate_crystal_01.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(II)_acetate","IUPAC name":"Tetra-μ2-acetatodiaquadicopper(II)","Other names":"Copper(II) ethanoate\nCupric acetate\nCopper Acetate\nVerdigris","CAS Number":"142-71-2 (anhydrous) Y\n6046-93-1 (hydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8555 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.049","PubChem CID":"8895","UNII":"39M11XPH03 Y","Chemical formula":"Cu(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"181.63 g/mol (anhydrous)\n199.65 g/mol (hydrate)","Appearance":"Dark green crystalline solid","Odor":"odorless (hydrate)","Density":"1.882 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hydrate)","Melting point":"Undetermined [1]","Boiling point":"240 °C (464 °F; 513 K)","Solubility in water":"hydrate:\n7.2 g/100 mL (cold water)\n20 g/100 mL (hot water)","Solubility":"Soluble in alcohol\nSlightly soluble in ether and glycerol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.545 (hydrate)","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic","Safety data sheet":"Baker MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"22-36/37/38-50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"26-60-61","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"710mg/kg oral rat [3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
