{"name":"Cadmium oxide","desc":"Cadmium oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CdO. It is one of the main precursors to other cadmium compounds. It crystallizes in a cubic rocksalt lattice like sodium chloride, with octahedral cation and anion centers. It occurs naturally as the rare mineral monteponite. Cadmium oxide can be found as a colorless amorphous powder or as brown or red crystals. Cadmium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.18 eV (2.31 eV) at room temperature (298 K).","images":[{"alt":"Oxid kademnatý.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Oxid_kademnat%C3%BD.JPG/200px-Oxid_kademnat%C3%BD.JPG"},{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_oxide","IUPAC name":"Cadmium oxide","Other names":"Cadmium(II) oxide,\nCadmium monoxide","CAS Number":"1306-19-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"14099 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.770","EC Number":"215-146-2","PubChem CID":"14782","RTECS number":"EV1925000","UN number":"2570","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Cadmium\">Cd</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"128.41 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless powder (alpha form)\nred-brown crystal (beta form) [1]","Odor":"odorless","Density":"8.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup>(crystalline),<br>\n6.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (amorphous)<sup id=\"cite_ref-NIOSH_sheet_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-NIOSH_sheet-2\">[2]</a></sup> solid.","Melting point":"900–1,000 °C (1,650–1,830 °F; 1,170–1,270 K)\ndecomposition of amorphous form[3]","Boiling point":"1,559 °C (2,838 °F; 1,832 K) sublimation[3]","Solubility in water":"4.8 mg/L (18 °C)[4]","Solubility":"soluble in dilute acid\nslowly soluble in ammonium salts\ninsoluble in alkalies","Vapor pressure":"0.13 kPa (1000 °C)\n2.62 kPa (1200 °C)\n61.4 kPa (1500 °C)[5]","Band gap":"2.18 eV","Electron mobility":"531 cm2/V·s","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-3.0·10−5</sup cm3/mol","Thermal conductivity":"0.7 W/m·K","Refractive index (nD)":"2.49","Crystal structure":"cubic, cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Lattice constant":"a = 4.6958 Å","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"43.64 J/mol·K[4]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"55 J/mol·K[6]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−258 kJ/mol[5][6]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-229.3 kJ/mol[4]","Safety data sheet":"[1]","GHS pictograms":"[7]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H330, H341, H350, H361, H372, H410[7]","GHS precautionary statements":"P201, P260, P273, P281, P284, P310[7]","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"72 mg/kg (oral, rat)[9]\n72 mg/kg (oral, mouse)[10]","LC50 (median concentration)":"500 mg/m3 (rat, 10 min)\n2500 mg/m3 (rabbit, 10 min)\n3500 mg/m3 (guinea pig, 10 min)\n4000 mg/m3 (dog, 10 min)\n780 mg/m3 (rat, 10 min)\n340 mg/m3 (mouse, 10 min)\n3000 mg/m3 (rabbit, 15 min)\n3000 mg/m3 (guinea pig, 15 min)\n400 mg/m3 (dog, 10 min)[10]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"[1910.1027] TWA 0.005 mg/m3 (as Cd)[8]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca[8]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [9 mg/m3 (as Cd)][8]","Other anions":"Cadmium sulfide\nCadmium selenide\nCadmium telluride","Other cations":"Zinc oxide\nMercury oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
