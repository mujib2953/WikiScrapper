{"name":"Iron pentacarbonyl","desc":"Iron pentacarbonyl, also known as iron carbonyl, is the compound with formula Fe(CO)5. Under standard conditions Fe(CO)5 is a free-flowing, straw-colored liquid with a pungent odour. Older samples appear darker. This compound is a common precursor to diverse iron compounds, including many that are useful in small scale organic synthesis.","images":[{"alt":"Iron carbonyl","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Fe%28CO%295.png/150px-Fe%28CO%295.png"},{"alt":"Iron carbonyl","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Iron-pentacarbonyl-from-xtal-3D-balls.png/150px-Iron-pentacarbonyl-from-xtal-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Iron carbonyl sample","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Sample_of_iron_pentacarbonyl.jpg/100px-Sample_of_iron_pentacarbonyl.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron_pentacarbonyl","IUPAC name":"pentacarbonyliron","Other names":"Pentacarbonyl iron\nIron carbonyl","CAS Number":"13463-40-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30251 Y","ChemSpider":"24254 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.323","PubChem CID":"26040","RTECS number":"NO4900000","UNII":"6WQ62TAQ6Z Y","UN number":"1994","Chemical formula":"Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"195.90 g/mol","Appearance":"straw-yellow liquid","Odor":"musty","Density":"1.453 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−21.0 °C (−5.8 °F; 252.2 K)","Boiling point":"103 °C (217 °F; 376 K)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Solubility":"Soluble in organic solvents\nslightly soluble in alcohol\ninsoluble in ammonia","Vapor pressure":"40 mmHg (30.6 °C)[1]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.5196 (20 °C)","Point group":"D3h","Coordination geometry":"trigonal bipyramidal","Molecular shape":"trigonal bipyramidal","Dipole moment":"0 D","Main hazards":"Very toxic, highly flammable","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0168","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"","NFPA 704":"3\n3\n1","Flash point":"−15 °C (5 °F; 258 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"49 °C (120 °F; 322 K)","Explosive limits":"3.7–12.5%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"25 mg/kg (rat, oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.1 ppm (0.23 mg/m3) ST 0.2 ppm (0.45 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[1]","Other cations":"Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl\nTriosmium dodecacarbonyl","Related iron carbonyls":"Diiron nonacarbonyl\nTriiron dodecacarbonyl","Related compounds":"Dimanganese decacarbonyl\nDicobalt octacarbonyl\nNickel tetracarbonyl","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
