{"name":"Indium(III) telluride","desc":"Indium(III) telluride (In2Te3) is a chemical compound. It is an intermetallic compound, so it has properties intermediate from a metal alloy and a metal-nonmetal ionic crystal. As so, it has intermediate conductivity and is classified as a semiconductor.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Indium(III)_telluride","Other names":"indium tritelluride","CAS Number":"1312-45-4 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.814","PubChem CID":"6383318","Chemical formula":"In<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"612.44 g/mol","Appearance":"blue cubic crystals","Density":"5.75 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"667 °C (1,233 °F; 940 K)[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
