{"name":"Hydroiodic acid","desc":"Hydroiodic acid (or hydriodic acid) is a highly acidic aqueous solution of hydrogen iodide (HI) (concentrated solution usually 48 - 57% HI). It is the second strongest hydrohalic acid, after hydroastatic acid. Hydroiodic acid is a commonly used chemical reagent and is one of the strong acids that ionize completely in an aqueous solution. Concentrated hydroiodic acid has a pH of less than 0.[citation needed]","images":[{"alt":"Space-filling model of hydrogen iodide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Hydrogen-iodide-3D-vdW.svg/100px-Hydrogen-iodide-3D-vdW.svg.png"},{"alt":"The iodide anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Iodide_ion.svg/100px-Iodide_ion.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydroiodic_acid","":"","Other names":"Hydronium iodide","CAS Number":"10034-85-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:47266 Y","ChemSpider":"255 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.087","EC Number":"233-113-0","PubChem CID":"260","RTECS number":"MW3760000","UNII":"3IY7CNP8XJ N","Chemical formula":"HI(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>","Molar mass":"127.91","Appearance":"colorless liquid","Odor":"acrid","Density":"1.70 g/mL, <a href=\"/wiki/Azeotrope\" title=\"Azeotrope\">azeotrope</a><br>\n(57% HI by weight)","Boiling point":"127 °C (261 °F; 400 K) 1.03 bar, azeotrope","Solubility in water":"Aqueous solution","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Corrosive (C)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R34","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S26, S45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Hydrofluoric acid\nHydrochloric acid\nHydrobromic acid","Related compounds":"Hydrogen iodide"}
