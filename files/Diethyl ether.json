{"name":"Diethyl ether","desc":"Diethyl ether, or simply ether, is an organic compound in the ether class with the formula (C\n2H\n5)\n2O. It is a colorless, highly volatile flammable liquid. It is commonly used as a solvent in laboratories and as a starting fluid for some engines. It was formerly used as a general anesthetic, until non-flammable drugs were developed, such as halothane. It has been used as a recreational drug to cause intoxication.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Diethylether_chemical_structure.svg/200px-Diethylether_chemical_structure.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Diethyl-ether-3D-balls.png/200px-Diethyl-ether-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Diethyl Ether Electron Rendering","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Diethyl_Ether_Electron_Rendering.png/200px-Diethyl_Ether_Electron_Rendering.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Diethyl_ether","IUPAC name":"Ethoxyethane","Other names":"Diethyl ether; Dether; Ethyl ether; Ethyl oxide; 3-Oxapentane; Ethoxyethane; Diethyl oxide; Solvent ether; Sulfuric ether","CAS Number":"60-29-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:35702 Y","ChemSpider":"3168 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.425","KEGG":"D01772 Y","PubChem CID":"3283","RTECS number":"KI5775000","UNII":"0F5N573A2Y Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>10</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"74.12 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Dry, sweetish odor[1]","Density":"0.7134 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, liquid","Melting point":"−116.3 °C (−177.3 °F; 156.8 K)","Boiling point":"34.6 °C (94.3 °F; 307.8 K) [2]","Solubility in water":"6.05 g/100 mL[3]","Vapor pressure":"440 mmHg (20°C)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-55.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.353 (20 °C)","Viscosity":"0.224 cP (25 °C)","Dipole moment":"1.15 D (gas)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"172.5 J/mol·K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"253.5 J/mol·K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-271.2 ± 1.9 kJ/mol","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"-2732.1 ± 1.9 kJ/mol","ATC code":"N01AA01 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Extremely Flammable, harmful to skin, decomposes to explosive peroxides in air and light[1]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nExternal MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12 R19 R20/22 R66 R67","S-phrases (outdated)":"S9 S16 S29 S33","NFPA 704":"4\n2\n1","Flash point":"−45 °C (−49 °F; 228 K) [6]","Autoignition\ntemperature":"160 °C (320 °F; 433 K)[6]","Explosive limits":"1.9-48.0% [4]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"73,000 ppm (rat, 2 hr)\n6500 ppm (mouse, 1.65 hr)[5]","LCLo (lowest published)":"106,000 ppm (rabbit)\n76,000 ppm (dog)[5]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 400 ppm (1200 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"No established REL[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1900 ppm[1]","Related Ethers":"Dimethyl ether\nMethoxypropane","Related compounds":"Diethyl sulfide\nButanols (isomer)","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
