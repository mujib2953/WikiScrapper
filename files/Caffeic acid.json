{"name":"Caffeic acid","desc":"Caffeic acid is an organic compound that is classified as a hydroxycinnamic acid. This yellow solid consists of both phenolic and acrylic functional groups. It is found in all plants because it is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, one of the principal components of plant biomass and its residues.","images":[{"alt":"2D diagram of caffeic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Kaffees%C3%A4ure.svg/200px-Kaffees%C3%A4ure.svg.png"},{"alt":"3D ball-and-stick model of caffeic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Cafeic-acid-3D.png/200px-Cafeic-acid-3D.png"},{"alt":"3D space filling model of caffeic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/CaffeicAcid3d.png/200px-CaffeicAcid3d.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Caffeic_acid","IUPAC names":"3-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid\n3,4-Dihydroxy-cinnamic acid\ntrans-Caffeate\n3,4-Dihydroxy-trans-cinnamate\n(E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid\n3,4-Dihydroxybenzeneacrylicacid\n3-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid","CAS Number":"331-39-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16433 Y","ChemSpider":"600426 Y","DrugBank":"DB01880 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.784","IUPHAR/BPS":"5155","KEGG":"C01481 Y","PubChem CID":"689043","UNII":"U2S3A33KVM Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"180.16 g/mol","Density":"1.478 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"223 to 225 °C (433 to 437 °F; 496 to 498 K)","UV-vis (λmax)":"327 nm and a shoulder at c. 295 nm in acidified methanol[1]","NFPA 704":"1\n1\n0","Related compounds":"Chlorogenic acid\nCichoric acid\nCoumaric acid\nQuinic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
