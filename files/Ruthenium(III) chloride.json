{"name":"Ruthenium(III) chloride","desc":"Ruthenium(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula RuCl3. \"Ruthenium(III) chloride\" more commonly refers to the hydrate RuCl3·xH2O. Both the anhydrous and hydrated species are dark brown or black solids. The hydrate, with a varying proportion of water of crystallization, often approximating to a trihydrate, is a commonly used starting material in ruthenium chemistry.","images":[{"alt":"Ruthenium Chloride Hydrate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Ruthenium_Chloride_Hydrate.jpg/200px-Ruthenium_Chloride_Hydrate.jpg"},{"alt":"Beta-RuCl3.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Beta-RuCl3.jpg/333px-Beta-RuCl3.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Ruthenium(III)_chloride","CAS Number":"10049-08-8 Y\n13815-94-6 (trihydrate) Y\n14898-67-0 (x-hydrate) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"74294 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.139","PubChem CID":"82323","RTECS number":"VM2650000","UNII":"RY8V1UJV23 N","Chemical formula":"RuCl<sub>3</sub>&#xB7;<i>x</i>H<sub>2</sub>O","Molar mass":"207.43 g/mol","Melting point":"> 500 °C (932 °F; 773 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"Soluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+1998.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"trigonal (RuCl3), hP8","Space group":"P3c1, No. 158","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Ruthenium(III) bromide","Other cations":"Rhodium(III) chloride\nIron(III) chloride","Related compounds":"Ruthenium tetroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
