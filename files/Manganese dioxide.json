{"name":"Manganese dioxide","desc":"Manganese(IV) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula MnO\n2. This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite, which is the main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for MnO\n2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc-carbon battery. MnO\n2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as KMnO\n4. It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. MnO\n2 in the α polymorph can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the \"tunnels\" or \"channels\" between the manganese oxide octahedra. There is considerable interest in α-MnO\n2 as a possible cathode for lithium ion batteries.","images":[{"alt":"Manganese(IV) oxideMn4O2","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Manganese%28IV%29_oxide.jpg/200px-Manganese%28IV%29_oxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Manganese_dioxide","IUPAC names":"Manganese oxide\nManganese(IV) oxide","Pyrolusite":"Pyrolusite, hyperoxide of manganese, black oxide of manganese, manganic oxide","CAS Number":"1313-13-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:136511 N","ChemSpider":"14117 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.821","EC Number":"215-202-6","PubChem CID":"14801","RTECS number":"OP0350000","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">MnO<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span></span>","Molar mass":"86.9368 g/mol","Appearance":"Brown-black solid","Density":"5.026 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"535 °C (995 °F; 808 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+2280.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"53 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−520 kJ·mol−1[1]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0175","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nOxidizer (O)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/22","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S25","NFPA 704":"1\n1\n2\nOX","Flash point":"535 °C (995 °F; 808 K)","Other anions":"Manganese disulfide","Other cations":"Technetium dioxide\nRhenium dioxide","Related manganese oxides":"Manganese(II) oxide\nManganese(II,III) oxide\nManganese(III) oxide\nManganese heptoxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
