{"name":"Wollastonite","desc":"Wollastonite is a calcium inosilicate mineral (CaSiO3) that may contain small amounts of iron, magnesium, and manganese substituting for calcium. It is usually white. It forms when impure limestone or dolostone is subjected to high temperature and pressure sometimes in the presence of silica-bearing fluids as in skarns or contact metamorphic rocks. Associated minerals include garnets, vesuvianite, diopside, tremolite, epidote, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene and calcite. It is named after the English chemist and mineralogist William Hyde Wollaston (1766â€“1828).","images":[{"alt":"WollastoniteUSGOV.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/WollastoniteUSGOV.jpg/240px-WollastoniteUSGOV.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Wollastonite"}
