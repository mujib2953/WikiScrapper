{"name":"Manganite","desc":"Manganite is a mineral composed of manganese oxide-hydroxide, MnO(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system (pseudo-orthorhombic). Crystals of manganite are prismatic and deeply striated parallel to their length; they are often grouped together in bundles. The color is dark steel-grey to iron-black, and the luster brilliant and submetallic. The streak is dark reddish brown. The hardness is 4, and the specific gravity is 4.3. There is a perfect cleavage parallel to the brachypinacoid, and less-perfect cleavage parallel to the prism faces. Twinned crystals are not infrequent.","images":[{"alt":"Manganite-180085.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Manganite-180085.jpg/240px-Manganite-180085.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Manganite"}
