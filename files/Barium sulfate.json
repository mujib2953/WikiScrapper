{"name":"Barium sulfate","desc":"Barium sulfate (or sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula BaSO4. It is a white crystalline solid that is odorless and insoluble in water. It occurs as the mineral barite, which is the main commercial source of barium and materials prepared from it. The white opaque appearance and its high density are exploited in its main applications.","images":[{"alt":"Chemical structure of barium sulfate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Barium-sulfate-2D.png/225px-Barium-sulfate-2D.png"},{"alt":"3D model of barium sulfate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Barite-unit-cell-3D-vdW.png/100px-Barite-unit-cell-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_tungstate","":"","CAS Number":"7727-43-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:133326 N","ChemSpider":"22823 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.896","EC Number":"231-784-4","PubChem CID":"24414","RTECS number":"CR060000","UNII":"25BB7EKE2E Y","Chemical formula":"BaSO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"233.38 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystalline","Odor":"odorless","Density":"4.49 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,580 °C (2,880 °F; 1,850 K)","Boiling point":"1,600 °C (2,910 °F; 1,870 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"0.0002448 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n0.000285 g/100 mL (30 °C)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"1.0842 × 10−10 (25 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohol,[1] soluble in concentrated, hot sulfuric acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-71.3·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.636 (alpha)","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"132 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1465 kJ·mol−1[2]","ATC code":"V08BA01 (WHO)","Routes of\nadministration":"by mouth, rectal","Pharmacokinetics":"","Bioavailability":"negligible by mouth","Excretion":"rectal","Legal status":"US: ℞-only","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n0\n0","Flash point":"noncombustible  [3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp)[3]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp)[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[3]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
