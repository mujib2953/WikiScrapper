{"name":"Calcium iodide","desc":"Calcium iodide (chemical formula CaI2) is the ionic compound of calcium and iodine. This colourless deliquescent solid is a salt that is highly soluble in water. Its properties are similar to those for related salts, such as calcium chloride. It is used in photography. It is also used in cat food as a source of iodine.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium iodide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cadmium-iodide-3D-balls.png/200px-Cadmium-iodide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_iodide","IUPAC name":"calcium iodide","CAS Number":"10102-68-8 Y\n13640-62-5 (tetrahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"59629 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.238","PubChem CID":"66244","RTECS number":"EV1300000","UNII":"8EKI9QEE2H Y","Chemical formula":"CaI<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"293.887 g/mol (anhydrous)\n365.95 g/mol (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"3.956 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<sup id=\"cite_ref-cond_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cond-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"779 °C (1,434 °F; 1,052 K) (anhydrous) [2]","Boiling point":"1,100 °C (2,010 °F; 1,370 K) [2]","Solubility in water":"64.6 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n66 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n81 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in acetone and alcohols","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-109.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Rhombohedral, hP3","Space group":"P-3m1, No. 164","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1","Other anions":"calcium fluoride\ncalcium chloride\ncalcium bromide","Other cations":"beryllium iodide\nmagnesium iodide\nstrontium iodide\nbarium iodide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
