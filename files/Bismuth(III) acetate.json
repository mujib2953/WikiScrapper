{"name":"Bismuth(III) acetate","desc":"Bismuth(III) acetate is an ionic salt composed of positive bismuth ions and negative acetate ions. The bismuth ions have a charge of 3+, while the acetate ions have a charge of 1-. Therefore, the empirical formula for bismuth(III) acetate is Bi1(AOC)3.","images":[{"alt":"Bismuth(III) acetate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Bismuth%28III%29_acetate.png/200px-Bismuth%28III%29_acetate.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Bismuth(III)_acetate","IUPAC name":"Bismuth(3+) triacetate","Other names":"Bismuth(III) acetate; Bismuth triacetate","ChemSpider":"28888","ECHA InfoCard":"100.040.806","Chemical formula":"Bi(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"386.112 g/mol","Appearance":"White crystals or powder"}
