{"name":"Rubidium hydride","desc":"Rubidium hydride is the hydride of rubidium. It has the formula RbH and is an alkali metal hydride. It is synthesized using rubidium metal to react with hydrogen gas. As a hydride of an alkali metal, it is reactive towards even weak oxidizing agents. A redox reaction will occur with chlorine or fluorine and a lot of heat will evolve. Rubidium hydride will react violently with water or air and careful storage is necessary.","images":[{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Rubidium_hydride","IUPAC name":"Rubidium hydride","Other names":"Rubidium(I) hydride","CAS Number":"13446-75-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","PubChem CID":"171411","Chemical formula":"RbH","Molar mass":"86.476 g/mol","Appearance":"white cubic crystals","Density":"2.60 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"Decomposes at 170°C","Solubility in water":"reacts","Crystal structure":"cubic, cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-52.3 kJ/mol","Other anions":"Rubidium oxide\nRubidium chloride","Other cations":"Lithium hydride\nSodium hydride\nPotassium hydride\nCaesium hydride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
