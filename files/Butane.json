{"name":"Butane","desc":"Butane (/ˈbjuːteɪn/) is an organic compound with the formula C4H10 that is an alkane with four carbon atoms. Butane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The term may refer to either of two structural isomers, n-butane or isobutane (also called \"methylpropane\"), or to a mixture of these isomers. In the IUPAC nomenclature, however, \"butane\" refers only to the n-butane isomer (which is the isomer with the unbranched structure). Butanes are highly flammable, colorless, easily liquefied gases. The name butane comes from the roots but- (from butyric acid, named after the Greek word for butter) and -ane. It was discovered by the chemist Edward Frankland in 1849.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of butane with all implicit hydrogens shown","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Butane_simple.svg/110px-Butane_simple.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the butane molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Butane-3D-balls.png/120px-Butane-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Butane","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[3]":"Butane[3]\nButane[3]","Systematic IUPAC name[3]":"Tetracarbane (never recommended[3])\nTetracarbane (never recommended[3])","[1][1][2]":"Butyl hydride[1]\nMethylethylmethane[1]\nQuartane[2]","CAS Number":"106-97-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"969129","ChEBI":"CHEBI:37808 Y","ChemSpider":"7555 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.136","EC Number":"203-448-7","E number":"E943a (glazing agents, ...)","Gmelin Reference":"1148","KEGG":"D03186 Y","MeSH":"butane","PubChem CID":"7843","RTECS number":"EJ4200000","UNII":"6LV4FOR43R Y","UN number":"1011","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>10</sub>","Molar mass":"58.12 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless gas","Odor":"Gasoline-like or natural gas-like[1]","Density":"2.48 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (at 15&#xA0;&#xB0;C (59&#xA0;&#xB0;F))","Melting point":"−140 to −134 °C; −220 to −209 °F; 133 to 139 K","Boiling point":"−1 to 1 °C; 30 to 34 °F; 272 to 274 K","Solubility in water":"61 mg L−1 (at 20 °C (68 °F))","log P":"2.745","Vapor pressure":"~170 kPa at 283 K [4]","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"11 nmol Pa−1 kg−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-57.4·10−6 cm3/mol","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"98.49 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−126.3–−124.9 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−2.8781–−2.8769 MJ mol−1","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H220","GHS precautionary statements":"P210","NFPA 704":"4\n1\n0","Flash point":"−60 °C (−76 °F; 213 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"405 °C (761 °F; 678 K)","Explosive limits":"1.8–8.4%","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 800 ppm (1900 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[1]","Related alkanes":"Propane\nIsobutane\nPentane","Related compounds":"Perfluorobutane","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
