{"name":"Bromic acid","desc":"Bromic acid, also known as hydrogen bromate, is an oxoacid with the molecular formula HBrO3. It only exists in aqueous solution. It is a colorless solution that turns yellow at room temperature as it decomposes to bromine. Bromic acid and bromates are powerful oxidizing agents and are common ingredients in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions. Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are a classic example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal model of bromic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Bromic_acid.svg/150px-Bromic_acid.svg.png"},{"alt":"Spacefill model of bromic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Bromic-acid-3D-vdW.png/150px-Bromic-acid-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Bromic_acid","IUPAC name":"Bromic acid","Other names":"Bromic(V) acid\nHydrogen bromate","CAS Number":"7789-31-3 N[correct]","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:49382 Y","ChemSpider":"22853 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.235","EC Number":"232-158-3","Gmelin Reference":"25861","MeSH":"Bromic+acid","PubChem CID":"24445","RTECS number":"TP8580000","Chemical formula":"<a href=\"/wiki/Hydrogen\" title=\"Hydrogen\">H</a><a href=\"/wiki/Bromine\" title=\"Bromine\">Br</a><a href=\"/wiki/Oxygen\" title=\"Oxygen\">O</a><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"128.91 g/mol","Acidity (pKa)":"−2","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
