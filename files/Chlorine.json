The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.","images":[{"alt":"Chlorine ampoule.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Chlorine_ampoule.jpg/220px-Chlorine_ampoule.jpg"},{"alt":"Chlorine spectrum visible.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Chlorine_spectrum_visible.png/220px-Chlorine_spectrum_visible.png"},{"alt":"Hydrogen (diatomic nonmetal)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Transparent.gif"}],"link":"/wiki/Chlorine","":"","sulfur ← chlorine → argon":"‍","ε":"36S","viewtalkeditreferencesin Wikidata":"view\ntalk\nedit"}
