{"name":"Tungsten ditelluride","desc":"Tungsten(IV) telluride (WTe2) is an inorganic semimetallic chemical compound. In October 2014, tungsten ditelluride was discovered to exhibit an extremely large magnetoresistance: 13 million percent with no known saturation point. The resistance is proportional to the square of the magnetic field. This may be due to the material being the first example of a compensated semimetal, in which the number of mobile holes is the same as the number of electrons. The structure of tungsten ditelluride is layered, and the substance can be exfoliated into thin sheets down to monolayers. However electrons can easily move between the layers, unlike in other two dimensional semiconductors. The fraction of charge carriers is 0.005 per formula unit (WTe2).","images":[{"alt":"WTe2 crystals.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/WTe2_crystals.jpg/250px-WTe2_crystals.jpg"},{"alt":"Tungsten ditelluride structure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Tungsten_ditelluride_structure.png/250px-Tungsten_ditelluride_structure.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tungsten(IV)_telluride","Other names":"tungsten ditelluride","CAS Number":"12067-76-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.884","EC Number":"235-086-0","PubChem CID":"82913","Chemical formula":"WTe<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"439.04 g/mol","Appearance":"gray crystals","Density":"9.43 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"1,020 °C (1,870 °F; 1,290 K)","Solubility in water":"negligible","Solubility":"insoluble in ammonia","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic, oP12","Space group":"Pmn21, No. 31","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
