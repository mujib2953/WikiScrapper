{"name":"Deoxyribose","desc":"Deoxyribose, or more precisely 2-deoxyribose, is a monosaccharide with idealized formula H−(C=O)−(CH2)−(CHOH)3−H. Its name indicates that it is a deoxy sugar, meaning that it is derived from the sugar ribose by loss of an oxygen atom. Since the pentose sugars arabinose and ribose only differ by the stereochemistry at C2′, 2-deoxyribose and 2-deoxyarabinose are equivalent, although the latter term is rarely used because ribose, not arabinose, is the precursor to deoxyribose.","images":[{"alt":"D-dexoyribose chain.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/D-dexoyribose_chain.png/100px-D-dexoyribose_chain.png"},{"alt":"D-deoxyribose chain-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/D-deoxyribose_chain-3D-balls.png/100px-D-deoxyribose_chain-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Deoxyribose","":"","IUPAC name":"2-deoxy-D-ribose","Other names":"2-deoxy-D-erythro-pentose\nthyminose","CAS Number":"533-67-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28816 Y","ChemSpider":"4573703 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.795","EC Number":"208-573-0","PubChem CID":"5460005","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>10</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"134.13 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White solid","Melting point":"91 °C (196 °F; 364 K)","Solubility in water":"Very soluble","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
