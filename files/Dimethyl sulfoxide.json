{"name":"Dimethyl sulfoxide","desc":"Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2SO. This colorless liquid is an important polar aprotic solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds and is miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. It has a relatively high melting point. DMSO has the unusual property that many individuals perceive a garlic-like taste in the mouth after contact with the skin.","images":[{"alt":"Dimethylsulfoxid.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Dimethylsulfoxid.svg/200px-Dimethylsulfoxid.svg.png"},{"alt":"Stereo structural formula of dimethyl sulfoxide with an explicit electron pair and assorted dimensions","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/DMSO-3D-balls.png/100px-DMSO-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Sample of Dimethyl sulfoxide 01.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Sample_of_Dimethyl_sulfoxide_01.jpg/200px-Sample_of_Dimethyl_sulfoxide_01.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide","":"","IUPAC name":"Dimethyl sulfoxide","Systematic IUPAC name":"Methanesulfinylmethane (substitutive)\nDimethyl(oxido)sulfur (additive)\nMethanesulfinylmethane (substitutive)\nDimethyl(oxido)sulfur (additive)","Other names":"Methylsulfinylmethane\nMethyl sulfoxide","CAS Number":"67-68-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","Abbreviations":"DMSO, Me2SO","Beilstein Reference":"506008","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28262 Y","ChemSpider":"659 Y","DrugBank":"DB01093 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.604","EC Number":"200-664-3","Gmelin Reference":"1556","KEGG":"D01043 Y","MeSH":"Dimethyl+sulfoxide","PubChem CID":"679","RTECS number":"PV6210000","UNII":"YOW8V9698H Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"78.13 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colourless liquid","Density":"1.1004 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"19 °C (66 °F; 292 K)","Boiling point":"189 °C (372 °F; 462 K)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Solubility in diethyl ether":"very soluble","Acidity (pKa)":"35[1]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.479\nεr = 48","Viscosity":"1.996 cP at 20 °C","Point group":"Cs","Molecular shape":"trigonal pyramidal","Dipole moment":"3.96 D","ATC code":"G04BX13 (WHO) M02AX03 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Irritant and flammable","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nOxford MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36/37/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26, S37/39","NFPA 704":"2\n1\n0","Flash point":"89 °C","Related sulfoxides":"diethyl sulfoxide","Related compounds":"sodium methylsulfinylmethylide,\ndimethyl sulfide,\ndimethyl sulfone,\nacetone","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
