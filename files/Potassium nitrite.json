{"name":"Potassium nitrite","desc":"Potassium nitrite (distinct from potassium nitrate) is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula KNO2. It is an ionic salt of potassium ions K+ and nitrite ions NO2−, which forms a white or slightly yellow, hygroscopic crystalline powder that is soluble in water.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium nitrite ball-and-stick.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Potassium_nitrite_ball-and-stick.png/200px-Potassium_nitrite_ball-and-stick.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_nitrite","CAS Number":"7758-09-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22857 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.939","EC Number":"231-832-4","E number":"E249 (preservatives)","PubChem CID":"516910","RTECS number":"TT3750000","UNII":"794654G42L Y","Chemical formula":"KNO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"85.10379 g/mol","Appearance":"white or slight yellow solid\ndeliquescent","Density":"1.914986 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"440.02 °C (824.04 °F; 713.17 K) (decomposes)","Boiling point":"537 °C (999 °F; 810 K) (explodes)","Solubility in water":"281 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n312 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n413 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ammonia","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−23.3·10−6 cm3/mol","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"107.4 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-369.8 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Oxidant (O)\nHarmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R8 R25 R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"S45 S61","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n2\nOX","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"235 mg/kg","Other anions":"Potassium nitrate","Other cations":"Sodium nitrite","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
