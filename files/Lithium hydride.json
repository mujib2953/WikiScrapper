{"name":"Lithium hydride","desc":"Lithium hydride is an inorganic compound with the formula LiH. This alkali metal hydride is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are grey. Characteristic of a salt-like, or ionic, hydride, it has a high melting point and is not soluble but reactive with all organic and protic solvents; it is soluble and non-reactive with certain molten salts such as lithium fluoride, lithium borohydride, and sodium hydride. With a molecular mass of slightly less than 8, it is the lightest ionic compound.","images":[{"alt":"Space-filling model of part of the crystal structure of lithium hydride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Lithium-hydride-3D-vdW.png/200px-Lithium-hydride-3D-vdW.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lithium_hydride","CAS Number":"7580-67-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56460 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.623","PubChem CID":"62714","RTECS number":"OJ6300000","Chemical formula":"LiH","Molar mass":"7.95 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless to gray solid[1]","Density":"0.78 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"688.7 °C (1,271.7 °F; 961.9 K)[1]","Boiling point":"decomposes at 900–1000 °C[2]","Solubility in water":"reacts","Solubility":"slightly soluble in dimethylformamide\nreacts with ammonia, diethyl ether, ethanol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−4.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.9847[3]:43","Crystal structure":"fcc (NaCl-type)","Lattice constant":"a = 0.40834 nm[3]:56","Dipole moment":"6.0 D[3]:35","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"3.51 J/(g·K)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"170.8 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-90.65 kJ/mol","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-68.48 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0813","NFPA 704":"2\n3\n2\nW","Autoignition\ntemperature":"200 °C (392 °F; 473 K)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"77.5 mg/kg (oral, rat)[5]","LC50 (median concentration)":"22 mg/m3 (rat, 4 hr)[6]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.025 mg/m3[4]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.025 mg/m3[4]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"0.5 mg/m3[4]","Other cations":"Sodium hydride\nPotassium hydride\nRubidium hydride\nCaesium hydride","Related compounds":"Lithium borohydride\nLithium aluminium hydride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
