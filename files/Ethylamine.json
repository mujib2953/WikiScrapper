{"name":"Ethylamine","desc":"Ethylamine is an organic compound with the formula CH3CH2NH2. This colourless gas has a strong ammonia-like odor. It is miscible with virtually all solvents and is a nucleophilic base, as is typical for amines. Ethylamine is widely used in chemical industry and organic synthesis.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of ethylamine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Ethylamine-2D-skeletal.png/100px-Ethylamine-2D-skeletal.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of ethylamine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Ethylamine-3D-balls.png/100px-Ethylamine-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ethylamine","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Ethanamine\nEthanamine","Other names":"Ethylamine","CAS Number":"75-04-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","3DMet":"B00176","Beilstein Reference":"505933","ChEBI":"CHEBI:15862 Y","ChemSpider":"6101 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.759","EC Number":"200-834-7","Gmelin Reference":"897","KEGG":"C00797 Y","MeSH":"ethylamine","PubChem CID":"6341","RTECS number":"KH2100000","UNII":"YG6MGA6AT5 Y","UN number":"1036","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span>","Molar mass":"45.09 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colourless gas","Odor":"fishy, ammoniacal","Melting point":"−85 to −79 °C; −121 to −110 °F; 188 to 194 K","Boiling point":"16 to 20 °C; 61 to 68 °F; 289 to 293 K","Solubility in water":"Miscible","log P":"0.037","Vapor pressure":"116.5 kPa (at 20 °C)","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"350 μmol Pa−1 kg−1","Acidity (pKa)":"10.8 (for the Conjugate acid)","Basicity (pKb)":"3.2","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−57.7 kJ mol−1","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H220, H319, H335","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P261, P305+351+338, P410+403","NFPA 704":"4\n3\n0","Flash point":"−37 °C (−35 °F; 236 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"383 °C (721 °F; 656 K)","Explosive limits":"3.5–14%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"265 mg kg−1 (dermal, rabbit)\n400 mg kg−1 (oral, rat)","LC50 (median concentration)":"1230 ppm (mammal)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"3000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n4000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 10 ppm (18 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 ppm (18 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"600 ppm[2]","Related alkanamines":"Methylamine\nEthylenediamine\nPropylamine\nIsopropylamine\n1,2-Diaminopropane\n1,3-Diaminopropane\nIsobutylamine\ntert-Butylamine","Related compounds":"Monomethylhydrazine\n2-Methyl-2-nitrosopropane","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
