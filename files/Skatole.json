{"name":"Skatole","desc":"Skatole or 3-methylindole is a mildly toxic white crystalline organic compound belonging to the indole family. It occurs naturally in feces (it is produced from tryptophan in the mammalian digestive tract) and coal tar and has a strong fecal odor. In low concentrations, it has a flowery smell and is found in several flowers and essential oils, including those of orange blossoms, jasmine, and Ziziphus mauritiana. It is used as a fragrance and fixative in many perfumes and as an aroma compound. Its name is derived from the Greek root skato- meaning \"dung\". Skatole was discovered in 1877 by the German physician Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919). Skatole is also used by U.S. military in its non-lethal weaponry; specifically, malodorants.","images":[{"alt":"Skatole structure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Skatole_structure.svg/100px-Skatole_structure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Skatole","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"3-Methyl-1H-indole\n3-Methyl-1H-indole","Other names":"3-Methylindole\n4-Methyl-2,3-benzopyrrole","CAS Number":"83-34-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:9171 Y","ChemSpider":"6480 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.001.338","PubChem CID":"6736","UNII":"9W945B5H7R Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span>","Molar mass":"131.18 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White crystalline solid","Melting point":"93 to 95 °C (199 to 203 °F; 366 to 368 K)","Boiling point":"265 °C (509 °F; 538 K)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
