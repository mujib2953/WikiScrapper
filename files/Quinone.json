{"name":"Quinone","desc":"The quinones represent a class of organic compounds that are formally \"derived from aromatic compounds [such as benzene or naphthalene] by conversion of an even number of –CH= groups into –C(=O)– groups with any necessary rearrangement of double bonds\", resulting in \"a fully conjugated cyclic dione structure\". The class includes some heterocyclic compounds.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Quinone"}
