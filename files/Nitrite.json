{"name":"Nitrite","desc":"The nitrite ion, which has the chemical formula NO−\n2, is a symmetric anion with equal N–O bond lengths. Upon protonation, the unstable weak acid nitrous acid is produced. Nitrite can be oxidized or reduced, with the product somewhat dependent on the oxidizing/reducing agent and its strength. The nitrite ion is an ambidentate ligand, and is known to bond to metal centers in at least five different ways. Nitrite is also important in biochemistry as a source of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide. In organic chemistry the –NO2 group is present in nitrous acid esters and nitro compounds. Nitrites are also used in the food production industry for curing meat.","images":[{"alt":"Nitrit-Ion2.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Nitrit-Ion2.svg/170px-Nitrit-Ion2.svg.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the nitrite ion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Nitrite-3D-vdW.png/100px-Nitrite-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nitrite_ion","":"","Systematic IUPAC name":"dioxidonitrate(1−)\ndioxidonitrate(1−)","Other names":"nitrite","CAS Number":"14797-65-0","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16301","ChemSpider":"921","EC Number":"233-272-6","PubChem CID":"946","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">NO<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\">&#x2212;<br>\n2</span></span>","Molar mass":"46.01 g·mol−1"}
