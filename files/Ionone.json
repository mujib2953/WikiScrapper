{"name":"Ionone","desc":"The ionones are a series of closely related chemical substances that are part of a group of compounds known as rose ketones, which also includes damascones and damascenones. Ionones are aroma compounds found in a variety of essential oils, including rose oil. β-Ionone is a significant contributor to the aroma of roses, despite its relatively low concentration, and is an important fragrance chemical used in perfumery. The ionones are derived from the degradation of carotenoids.","images":[{"alt":"alpha-ionone","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Alpha-ionone-label.png/120px-Alpha-ionone-label.png"},{"alt":"beta-ionone","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Beta-ionone-label.png/120px-Beta-ionone-label.png"},{"alt":"gamma-ionone","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Gamma-ionone-label.png/120px-Gamma-ionone-label.png"}],"link":"/wiki/%CE%92-ionone","":"","IUPAC names":"α: (3E)-4-(2,6,6-Trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl)but-3-en-2-one\nβ: (3E)-4-(2,6,6-Trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)but-3-en-2-one\nγ: (3E)-4-(2,2-Dimethyl-6-methylenecyclohexyl)but-3-en-2-one","Other names":"Cyclocitrylideneacetone, irisone, jonon","CAS Number":"127-41-3 α N\n79-77-6 β N\n79-76-5 γ N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:49250 Y","ChemSpider":"4516050 Y","PubChem CID":"5363741","UNII":"QP734LIN1K Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O","Molar mass":"192.30 g/mol","Density":"&#x3B1;: 0.933 g/cm<sup>3</sup><br>\n&#x3B2;: 0.945 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"β: −49 °C (−56 °F; 224 K)","Boiling point":"β: 126 to 128 °C (259 to 262 °F; 399 to 401 K) at 12 mmHg","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
