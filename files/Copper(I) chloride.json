{"name":"Copper(I) chloride","desc":"Copper(I) chloride, commonly called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance is a white solid sparingly soluble in water, but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Impure samples appear green due to the presence of copper(II) chloride.","images":[{"alt":"Unit cell of nantokite","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Nantokite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/180px-Nantokite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Sample of copper(I) chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Copper%28I%29-chloride-sample.jpg/230px-Copper%28I%29-chloride-sample.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(I)_chloride","IUPAC name":"Copper(I) chloride","Other names":"Cuprous chloride","CAS Number":"7758-89-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:53472 Y","ChemSpider":"56403 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.948","EC Number":"231-842-9","PubChem CID":"62652","RTECS number":"GL6990000","Chemical formula":"CuCl","Molar mass":"98.999 g/mol[1]","Appearance":"white powder, slightly green from oxidized impurities","Density":"4.14&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"423 °C (793 °F; 696 K) [1]","Boiling point":"1,490 °C (2,710 °F; 1,760 K) (decomposes)[1]","Solubility in water":"0.047 g/L (20 °C)[1]","Solubility product (Ksp)":"1.72×10−7","Solubility":"insoluble in ethanol\nacetone;[1] soluble in concentrated HCl, NH4OH","Band gap":"3.25 eV (300 K, direct)[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-40.0·10−6 cm3/mol[3]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.930[4]","Crystal structure":"Zincblende, cF20","Space group":"F43m, No. 216[5]","Lattice constant":"a = 0.54202 nm","Lattice volume (V)":"0.1592 nm3","Formula units (Z)":"4","Safety data sheet":"JT Baker","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S22, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"140 mg/kg","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[6]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[6]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[6]","Other anions":"Copper(I) bromide\nCopper(I) iodide","Other cations":"Copper(II) chloride\nSilver(I) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
