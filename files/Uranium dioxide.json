{"name":"Uranium dioxide","desc":"Uranium dioxide or uranium(IV) oxide (UO2), also known as urania or uranous oxide, is an oxide of uranium, and is a black, radioactive, crystalline powder that naturally occurs in the mineral uraninite. It is used in nuclear fuel rods in nuclear reactors. A mixture of uranium and plutonium dioxides is used as MOX fuel. Prior to 1960, it was used as yellow and black color in ceramic glazes and glass.","images":[{"alt":"UO2lattice.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/UO2lattice.jpg/200px-UO2lattice.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Uranium_dioxide","IUPAC names":"Uranium dioxide\nUranium(IV) oxide","Other names":"Urania\nUranous oxide","CAS Number":"1344-57-6 Y","ChemSpider":"10454 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.014.273","RTECS number":"YR4705000","Chemical formula":"UO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"270.03 g/mol","Appearance":"black powder","Density":"10.97 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,865 °C (5,189 °F; 3,138 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Crystal structure":"Fluorite (cubic), cF12","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Lattice constant":"a = 547.1 pm [1]","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (O2−); cubic (UIV)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"78 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1084 kJ·mol−1[2]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1251","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Very toxic (T+)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R26/28, R33, R51/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S20/21, S45, S61","Flash point":"N/A","Related uranium oxides":"Triuranium octoxide\nUranium trioxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
