{"name":"Succinic acid","desc":"Succinic acid (/səkˈsɪnᵻk/) is a dicarboxylic acid with the chemical formula (CH2)2(CO2H)2. The name derives from Latin succinum, meaning amber. In living organisms, succinic acid takes the form of an anion, succinate, which has multiple biological roles both as a metabolic intermediate and as a signaling molecule reflecting the cellular metabolic state. Succinate is generated in mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), an ancient energy-yielding process shared by all organisms. Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space, changing gene expression patterns, modulating epigenetic landscape or demonstrating hormone-like signaling. As such, succinate links cellular metabolism to the regulation of cellular function. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis and degradation can lead to pathological conditions, such as malignant transformation, inflammation and tissue injury.","images":[{"alt":"Bernsteinsäure2.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Bernsteins%C3%A4ure2.svg/200px-Bernsteins%C3%A4ure2.svg.png"},{"alt":"Succinic-acid-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Succinic-acid-3D-balls.png/200px-Succinic-acid-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Sample of succinic acid.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Sample_of_succinic_acid.jpg/200px-Sample_of_succinic_acid.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Succinic_acid","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Butanedioic acid[1]\nButanedioic acid[1]","[1]":"Succinic acid[1]\n1,4-Butanedioic Acid","CAS Number":"110-15-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:15741 Y","ChemSpider":"1078 Y","DrugBank":"DB00139 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.402","E number":"E363 (antioxidants, ...)","IUPHAR/BPS":"3637","PubChem CID":"1110","UNII":"AB6MNQ6J6L Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"118.09 g·mol−1","Density":"1.56 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-GESTIS_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GESTIS-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"184 °C (363 °F; 457 K)[2]","Boiling point":"235 °C (455 °F; 508 K)[2]","Solubility in water":"58 g/L (20 °C)[2] or 100 mg/mL[3]","Solubility in Methanol":"158 mg/mL[3]","Solubility in Ethanol":"54 mg/mL[3]","Solubility in Acetone":"27 mg/mL[3]","Solubility in Glycerol":"50 mg/mL[3]","Solubility in Ether":"8.8 mg/mL[3]","Acidity (pKa)":"pKa1 = 4.2\npKa2 = 5.6","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-57.9·10−6 cm3/mol","Flash point":"206 °C (403 °F; 479 K)[2]","Other anions":"sodium succinate","Related carboxylic acids":"propionic acid\nmalonic acid\nbutyric acid\nmalic acid\ntartaric acid\nfumaric acid\nvaleric acid\nglutaric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
