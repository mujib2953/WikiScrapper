{"name":"Calcium sulfate","desc":"Calcium sulfate (or calcium sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the formula CaSO4 and related hydrates. In the form of γ-anhydrite (the anhydrous form), it is used as a desiccant. One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris, and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum. It has many uses in industry. All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water. Calcium sulfate causes permanent hardness in water.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium sulfate anhydrous","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/CaSO4.tif/lossless-page1-200px-CaSO4.tif.png"},{"alt":"Calcium sulfate hemihydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Calcium_sulfate_hemihydrate.jpg/200px-Calcium_sulfate_hemihydrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_sulfate","Plaster of ParisGypsum":"Plaster of Paris\nDrierite\nGypsum","CAS Number":"7778-18-9 Y\n10034-76-1 (hemihydrate) N\n10101-41-4 (dihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:31346 Y","ChemSpider":"22905 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.000","E number":"E516 (acidity regulators, ...)","KEGG":"D09201 N","PubChem CID":"24928","RTECS number":"WS6920000","UNII":"E934B3V59H Y","Chemical formula":"CaSO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"136.14 g/mol (anhydrous)\n145.15 g/mol (hemihydrate)\n172.172 g/mol (dihydrate)","Appearance":"white solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.96 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.32 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)","Melting point":"1,460 °C (2,660 °F; 1,730 K) (anhydrous)","Solubility in water":"0.21g/100ml at 20 °C (anhydrous)[1]\n0.24 g/100ml at 20 °C (dihydrate)[2]","Solubility product (Ksp)":"4.93 × 10−5 mol2L−2 (anhydrous)\n3.14 × 10−5 (dihydrate)\n[3]","Solubility in glycerol":"slightly soluble (dihydrate)","Acidity (pKa)":"10.4 (anhydrous)\n7.3 (dihydrate)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-49.7·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"107 J·mol−1·K−1 [4]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-1433 kJ/mol[4]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nICSC 1589","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp) [for anhydrous form only][5]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp) [anhydrous only][5]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[5]","Other cations":"Magnesium sulfate\nStrontium sulfate\nBarium sulfate","Related desiccants":"Calcium chloride\nMagnesium sulfate","Related compounds":"Plaster of Paris\nGypsum","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
