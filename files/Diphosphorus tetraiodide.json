{"name":"Diphosphorus tetraiodide","desc":"Diphosphorus tetraiodide is an orange crystalline solid with the formula P2I4. It has been used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is a rare example of a compound with phosphorus in the +2 oxidation state, and can be classified as a subhalide of phosphorus. It is the most stable of the diphosphorus tetrahalides.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the diphosphorus tetraiodide molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Diphosphorus-tetraiodide-3D-balls.png/200px-Diphosphorus-tetraiodide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Diphosphorus_tetraiodide","IUPAC name":"Diphosphorus tetraiodide","Preferred IUPAC name":"Tetraiododiphosphane\nTetraiododiphosphane","Other names":"Phosphorus(II) iodide","CAS Number":"13455-00-0 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.301","Chemical formula":"P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"569.57 g/mol","Appearance":"Orange crystalline solid","Melting point":"124 to 127 °C (255 to 261 °F; 397 to 400 K)","Boiling point":"Decomposes","Solubility in water":"Decomposes","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"C","R-phrases (outdated)":"R14, R34, R37","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Diphosphorus tetrafluoride\nDiphosphorus tetrachloride\nDiphosphorus tetrabromide","Other cations":"diarsenic tetraiodide","Related Binary Phosphorus halides":"phosphorus triiodide","Related compounds":"diphosphane\ndiphosphines","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
