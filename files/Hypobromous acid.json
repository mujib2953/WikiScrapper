{"name":"Hypobromous acid","desc":"Hypobromous acid is a very weak and unstable acid with chemical formula of HOBr. It is also called bromic(I) acid, bromanol or hydroxidobromine. It occurs only in solution and has chemical and physical properties that are very similar to those of other hypohalites. Its salts (hypobromites) are also unstable.","images":[{"alt":"Hypobromous acid.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Hypobromous_acid.png/200px-Hypobromous_acid.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of hypobromous acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Hypobromous-acid-3D-vdW.png/150px-Hypobromous-acid-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hypobromous_acid","IUPAC name":"hypobromous acid, bromic(I) acid","CAS Number":"13517-11-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29249 Y","ChemSpider":"75379 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.119.006","PubChem CID":"83547","Chemical formula":"HBrO","Molar mass":"96.911","Density":"2.470 g/cm","Boiling point":"20–25 °C (68–77 °F; 293–298 K)","Acidity (pKa)":"8.65","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
