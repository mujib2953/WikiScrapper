{"name":"Iodine monochloride","desc":"Iodine monochloride is an interhalogen compound with the formula ICl. It is a red-brown chemical compound that melts near room temperature. Because of the difference in the electronegativity of iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and behaves as a source of I+.","images":[{"alt":"I-Cl bond length = 232.07 pm","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Iodine-monochloride-2D.png/100px-Iodine-monochloride-2D.png"},{"alt":"A sample of Iodine monochloride reagent","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Iodine_monochloride1.jpg/150px-Iodine_monochloride1.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Iodine_monochloride","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Iodine monochloride\nIodine(I) chloride\nIodine monochloride\nIodine(I) chloride","Systematic IUPAC name":"Chloroiodane\nChloroiodane","Other names":"Iodine chloride","CAS Number":"7790-99-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23042 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.306","EC Number":"232-236-7","MeSH":"Iodine-monochloride","PubChem CID":"24640","UN number":"1792","Chemical formula":"ICl","Molar mass":"162.35 g/mol","Appearance":"reddish-brown","Density":"3.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"27.2 °C (81.0 °F; 300.3 K) (α-form)\n13.9 °C (β-form)","Boiling point":"97.4 °C (207.3 °F; 370.5 K)","Solubility in water":"hydrolysis","Solubility":"soluble in CS2\nacetic acid\npyridine\nalcohol, ether, HCl","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−54.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Main hazards":"corrosive","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","Related interhalogen compounds":"Chlorine monofluoride\nBromine monochloride\nIodine monobromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
