{"name":"Cerium(III) chloride","desc":"Cerium(III) chloride (CeCl3), also known as cerous chloride or cerium trichloride, is a compound of cerium and chlorine. It is a white hygroscopic solid; it rapidly absorbs water on exposure to moist air to form a hydrate, which appears to be of variable composition, though the heptahydrate CeCl3·7 H2O is known. It is highly soluble in water, and (when anhydrous) it is soluble in ethanol and acetone.","images":[{"alt":"Cerium(III) chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/CeriumIIIchloride.jpg/200px-CeriumIIIchloride.jpg"},{"alt":"UCl3 without caption.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/UCl3_without_caption.png/100px-UCl3_without_caption.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cerium(III)_chloride","":"","IUPAC names":"Cerium(III) chloride\nCerium trichloride","Other names":"Cerous chloride","CAS Number":"7790-86-5 Y\n18618-55-8 (heptahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:35458 Y","ChemSpider":"23038 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.298","PubChem CID":"24636","UNII":"TH8E3IE00V N","Chemical formula":"CeCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"246.48 g/mol (anhydrous)\n372.58 g/mol (heptahydrate)","Appearance":"fine white powder","Density":"3.97 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"817 °C (1,503 °F; 1,090 K) (anhydrous)\n90 °C (heptahydrate, decomposes)","Boiling point":"1,727 °C (3,141 °F; 2,000 K)","Solubility in water":"100 g/100 ml","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+2490.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"hexagonal (UCl3 type), hP8","Space group":"P63/m, No. 176","Coordination geometry":"Tricapped trigonal prismatic\n(nine-coordinate)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Not listed","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Cerium(III) oxide\nCerium(III) fluoride\nCerium(III) bromide\nCerium(III) iodide","Other cations":"Lanthanum(III) chloride\nPraseodymium(III) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
