{"name":"Lactic acid","desc":"Lactic acid is an organic compound with the formula CH3CH(OH)COOH. In its solid state, it is white and water-soluble. In its liquid state, it is clear. It is produced both naturally and synthetically. With a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group, lactic acid is classified as an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). In the form of its conjugate base called lactate, it plays a role in several biochemical processes.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of L-lactic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lactic-acid-skeletal.svg/110px-Lactic-acid-skeletal.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lactic_acid","L-Lactic acid":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"2-Hydroxypropanoic acid\n2-Hydroxypropanoic acid","Other names":"Lactic acid\nMilk acid","CAS Number":"50-21-5 Y\n79-33-4 (L) Y\n10326-41-7 (D) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:422 Y","ChemSpider":"96860 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.017","E number":"E270 (preservatives)","IUPHAR/BPS":"2932","UNII":"33X04XA5AT N","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"90.08 g·mol−1","Melting point":"53°C","Boiling point":"122 °C (252 °F; 395 K) @ 15 mmHg","Acidity (pKa)":"3.86,[1] 15.1[2]","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"1361.9 kJ/mol, 325.5 kcal/mol, 15.1 kJ/g, 3.61 kcal/g","ATC code":"G01AD01 (WHO) QP53AG02 (WHO)","GHS pictograms":"[3]","GHS hazard statements":"H315, H318[3]","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P305+351+338[3]","Other anions":"lactate","Related carboxylic acids":"acetic acid\nglycolic acid\npropionic acid\n3-hydroxypropanoic acid\nmalonic acid\nbutyric acid\nhydroxybutyric acid","Related compounds":"1-propanol\n2-propanol\npropionaldehyde\nacrolein\nsodium lactate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
