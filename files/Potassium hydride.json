{"name":"Potassium hydride","desc":"Potassium hydride, KH, is the inorganic compound of potassium and hydride. It is an alkali metal hydride. It is a white solid, although commercial samples appear gray. A powerful base that is useful in organic synthesis, it is also a dangerously reactive compound. For this reason it is sold commercially as a slurry (~35%) in mineral oil or sometimes paraffin wax to facilitate dispensing.","images":[{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_hydride","CAS Number":"7693-26-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"74121 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.823","EC Number":"232-151-5","PubChem CID":"82127","Chemical formula":"KH","Molar mass":"40.1062 g/mol","Appearance":"colourless crystals","Density":"1.43 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-eEROS_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-eEROS-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"decomposes at ~400 °C[2]","Solubility in water":"reacts","Solubility":"insoluble in benzene, diethyl ether, CS2","Crystal structure":"cubic, cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"37.91 J/(mol K)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-57.82 kJ/mol","Other cations":"Lithium hydride\nSodium hydride\nRubidium hydride\nCaesium hydride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
