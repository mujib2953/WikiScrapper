{"name":"Barium iodide","desc":"Barium iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula BaI2. The compound exists as an anhydrous and a hydrate (BaI2(H2O)2), both of which are white solids. When heated, hydrated barium iodide converts to the anhydrous salt. The hydrated form is freely soluble in water, ethanol, and acetone.","images":[{"alt":"Cotunnite structure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Cotunnite_structure.png/200px-Cotunnite_structure.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_iodide","IUPAC name":"Barium iodide","Other names":"Barium iodide, anhydrous","CAS Number":"13718-50-8 (anhydrous) Y\n7787-33-9 (dihydrate) N\n13477-15-1 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"75507 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.873","EC Number":"237-276-9","PubChem CID":"83684","Chemical formula":"BaI<sub>2</sub> (anhydrous)<br>\nBaI<sub>2</sub>&#xB7;2H<sub>2</sub>O (dihydrate)","Molar mass":"391.136 g/mol (anhydrous)\n427.167 g/mol (dihydrate)","Appearance":"White orthorhombic crystals (anhydrous) colorless crystals (dihydrate)","Odor":"odorless","Density":"5.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n4.916 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)","Melting point":"711 °C (1,312 °F; 984 K) (anhydrous)\ndecomposes at 740 °C (dihydrate)","Solubility in water":"166.7 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n221 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n246.6 g/100 mL (70 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, acetone","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-124.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP12, SpaceGroup = Pnma, No. 62","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-602.1 kJ·mol−1","Main hazards":"toxic","Other anions":"barium fluoride\nbarium chloride\nbarium bromide","Other cations":"beryllium iodide\nmagnesium iodide\ncalcium iodide\nstrontium iodide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
