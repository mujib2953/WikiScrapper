{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","desc":"Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula H\n2O\n2. In its pure form, it is a colourless liquid, slightly more viscous than water. Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygen–oxygen single bond). It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent and disinfectant. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \"high-test peroxide\", is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry. Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of hydrogen peroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Wasserstoffperoxid.svg/100px-Wasserstoffperoxid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide","":"","IUPAC name":"Hydrogen peroxide","Other names":"Dioxidane\nOxidanyl\nPerhydroxic acid","CAS Number":"7722-84-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16240 Y","ChemSpider":"763 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.878","EC Number":"231-765-0","IUPHAR/BPS":"2448","KEGG":"D00008 Y","PubChem CID":"784","RTECS number":"MX0900000 (>90% soln.)\nMX0887000 (>30% soln.)","UNII":"BBX060AN9V Y","UN number":"2015 (>60% soln.)\n2014 (20–60% soln.)\n2984 (8–20% soln.)","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>","Molar mass":"34.0147 g/mol","Appearance":"Very light blue color; colorless in solution","Odor":"slightly sharp","Density":"1.11&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20&#xA0;&#xB0;C, 30% (w/w) solution )<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup><br>\n1.450&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20&#xA0;&#xB0;C, pure)","Melting point":"−0.43 °C (31.23 °F; 272.72 K)","Boiling point":"150.2 °C (302.4 °F; 423.3 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Solubility":"soluble in ether, alcohol\ninsoluble in petroleum ether","Vapor pressure":"5 mmHg (30 °C)[2]","Acidity (pKa)":"11.75","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−17.7·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4061","Viscosity":"1.245 cP (20 °C)","Dipole moment":"2.26 D","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"1.267 J/(g·K) (gas)\n2.619 J/(g·K) (liquid)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−187.80 kJ/mol","ATC code":"A01AB02 (WHO) D08AX01 (WHO), S02AA06 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0164 (>60% soln.)","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"danger","GHS hazard statements":"H271, H302, H314, H332, H335, H412","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P305+351+338, P310","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2\nOX","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1518 mg/kg[citation needed]\n2000 mg/kg (oral, mouse)[3]","LC50 (median concentration)":"1418 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"227 ppm (mouse)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 ppm (1.4 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 ppm (1.4 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"75 ppm[2]","Related compounds":"Water\nOzone\nHydrazine\nHydrogen disulfide\nDioxygen difluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
