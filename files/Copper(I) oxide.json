{"name":"Copper(I) oxide","desc":"Copper(I) oxide or cuprous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Cu2O. It is one of the principal oxides of copper, the other being CuO or cupric oxide. This red-coloured solid is a component of some antifouling paints. The compound can appear either yellow or red, depending on the size of the particles. Copper(I) oxide is found as the reddish mineral cuprite.","images":[{"alt":"Copper(I) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/CopperIoxide.jpg/150px-CopperIoxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Copper(I) oxide unit cell","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Copper%28I%29-oxide-unit-cell-A-3D-balls.png/150px-Copper%28I%29-oxide-unit-cell-A-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Copper(I)-oxide-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Copper%28I%29-oxide-3D-balls.png/200px-Copper%28I%29-oxide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(I)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Copper(I) oxide","Cuprite":"Cuprous oxide\nDicopper oxide\nCuprite\nRed copper oxide","CAS Number":"1317-39-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"8488659 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.883","EC Number":"215-270-7","KEGG":"C18714 Y","PubChem CID":"10313194","RTECS number":"GL8050000","UNII":"T8BEA5064F Y","Chemical formula":"Cu<sub>2</sub>O","Molar mass":"143.09 g/mol","Appearance":"brownish-red solid","Density":"6.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,232 °C (2,250 °F; 1,505 K)","Boiling point":"1,800 °C (3,270 °F; 2,070 K)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Solubility in acid":"Soluble","Band gap":"2.137 eV","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-20·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"93 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−170 kJ·mol−1","Safety data sheet":"SIRI.org","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S22, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[1]","Other anions":"Copper(I) sulfide\nCopper(II) sulfide\nCopper(I) selenide","Other cations":"Copper(II) oxide\nSilver(I) oxide\nNickel(II) oxide\nZinc oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
