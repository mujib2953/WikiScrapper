{"name":"Nickel(II) oxide","desc":"Nickel(II) oxide is the chemical compound with the formula NiO. It is notable as being the only well-characterized oxide of nickel (although nickel(III) oxide, Ni\n2O\n3 and NiO\n2 have been claimed). The mineralogical form of NiO, bunsenite, is very rare. It is classified as a basic metal oxide. Several million kilograms are produced in varying quality annually, mainly as an intermediate in the production of nickel alloys.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel(II) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png/200px-Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png"},{"alt":"Nickel(II) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Oxid_nikelnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Oxid_nikelnat%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel(II)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Nickel(II) oxide","Other names":"Nickel monoxide\nOxonickel","CAS Number":"1313-99-1 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.833","PubChem CID":"14805","RTECS number":"QR8400000","Chemical formula":"NiO","Molar mass":"74.6928 g/mol","Appearance":"green crystalline solid","Density":"6.67 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,955 °C (3,551 °F; 2,228 K)","Solubility in water":"negligible","Solubility":"soluble in KCN","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+660.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.1818","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-240.0 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"JT Baker","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Carc.
