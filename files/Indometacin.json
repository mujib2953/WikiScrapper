{"name":"Indometacin","desc":"Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins.","images":[{"alt":"Indometacin.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Indometacin.svg/225px-Indometacin.svg.png"},{"alt":"Indometacin-from-xtal-2003-ball-and-stick.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Indometacin-from-xtal-2003-ball-and-stick.png/225px-Indometacin-from-xtal-2003-ball-and-stick.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Indometacin"}
