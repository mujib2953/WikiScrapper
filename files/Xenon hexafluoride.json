{"name":"Xenon hexafluoride","desc":"Xenon hexafluoride is a noble gas compound with the formula XeF6 and the highest of the three known binary fluorides of xenon, the other two being XeF2 and XeF4. All known are exergonic and stable at normal temperatures. XeF6 is the strongest fluorinating agent of the series. At room temperature, it is a colorless solid that readily sublimes into intensely yellow vapors.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Xenonhexafluorid.svg/100px-Xenonhexafluorid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Xenon_hexafluoride","":"","CAS Number":"13693-09-9 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"123066 Y","PubChem CID":"139546","Chemical formula":"XeF<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"245.28 g mol−1","Density":"3.56 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"49.25 °C (120.65 °F; 322.40 K)","Boiling point":"75.6 °C (168.1 °F; 348.8 K)","Solubility in water":"reacts","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−294 kJ·mol−1[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
