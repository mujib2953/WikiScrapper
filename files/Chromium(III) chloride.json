{"name":"Chromium(III) chloride","desc":"Chromium(III) chloride (also called chromic chloride) describes any of several compounds of with the formula CrCl3(H2O)x, where x can be 0, 5, and 6. The anhydrous compound with the formula CrCl3 is a violet solid. The most common form of the trichloride is the dark green \"hexahydrate\", CrCl3.6H2O. Chromium chloride finds uses as catalysts and as precursors to dyes for wool.","images":[{"alt":"Chromium(III)-chloride-purple-anhydrous-sunlight.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Chromium%28III%29-chloride-purple-anhydrous-sunlight.jpg/200px-Chromium%28III%29-chloride-purple-anhydrous-sunlight.jpg"},{"alt":"Green form of chromium(III) chloride hexahydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Chromium_chloride.jpg/200px-Chromium_chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(III)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Chromium(III) chloride\nChromium trichloride","Other names":"Chromic chloride","CAS Number":"10025-73-7 Y\n10060-12-5 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:53351 Y","ChemSpider":"4954736 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.023","PubChem CID":"6452300","RTECS number":"GB5425000","UNII":"Z310X5O5RP Y","Chemical formula":"CrCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"158.36 g/mol (anhydrous)\n266.45 g/mol (hexahydrate)[1]","Appearance":"purple when anhydrous, dark green when hexahydrate","Density":"2.87 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.760 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)","Melting point":"1,152 °C (2,106 °F; 1,425 K) (anhydrous)\n83 °C (hexahydrate)","Boiling point":"1,300 °C (2,370 °F; 1,570 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"slightly soluble (anhydrous)\n585 g/L (hexahydrate)","Solubility":"insoluble in ethanol\ninsoluble in ether, acetone","Acidity (pKa)":"2.4 (0.2M solution)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+6890.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"YCl3 structure","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1316 (anhydrous)\nICSC 1532 (hexahydrate)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1870 mg/kg (oral, rat)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"250 mg/m3[2]","Other anions":"Chromium(III) fluoride\nChromium(III) bromide\nChromium(III) iodide","Other cations":"Molybdenum(III) chloride\nTungsten(III) chloride","Related compounds":"Chromium(II) chloride\nChromium(IV) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
