{"name":"Decane","desc":"Decane is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C10H22. Although 75 structural isomers are possible for decane, the term usually refers to the normal-decane (\"n-decane\"), with the formula CH3(CH2)8CH3. All isomers, however, exhibit similar properties and little attention is paid to the composition. These isomers are flammable liquids. Decane is a component of gasoline (petrol) and kerosene. Like other alkanes, it is nonpolar solvent, does not dissolve in water, and is readily combustable. Although it is a component of fuels, it is of little importance as a chemical feedstock, unlike a handful of other alkanes.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of decane","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Decane-2D-Skeletal.svg/250px-Decane-2D-Skeletal.svg.png"},{"alt":"Skeletal formula of decane with all implicit carbons shown, and all explicit hydrogens added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/DecaneFull.png/250px-DecaneFull.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the decane molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Decane_3D_ball.png/250px-Decane_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Decane","IUPAC name[1]":"Decane[1]","CAS Number":"124-18-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"1696981","ChEBI":"CHEBI:41808 Y","ChemSpider":"14840 Y","DrugBank":"DB02826 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.004.262","EC Number":"204-686-4","MeSH":"decane","PubChem CID":"15600","RTECS number":"HD6550000","UN number":"2247","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>10</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>22</sub>","Molar mass":"142.29 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Gasoline-like","Density":"0.730 g mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>","Melting point":"−30.5 to −29.2 °C; −22.8 to −20.6 °F; 242.7 to 243.9 K","Boiling point":"173.8 to 174.4 °C; 344.7 to 345.8 °F; 446.9 to 447.5 K","log P":"5.802","Vapor pressure":"195 Pa[2]","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"2.1 nmol Pa−1 kg−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-119.74·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.411–1.412","Viscosity":"920 μPa s (at 20 °C)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"315.46 J K−1 mol−1","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"425.89 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−302.1–−299.9 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−6779.21–−6777.45 kJ mol−1","Safety data sheet":"hazard.com","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H226, H304","GHS precautionary statements":"P301+310, P331","NFPA 704":"2\n1\n0","Flash point":"46.0 °C (114.8 °F; 319.1 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"210.0 °C (410.0 °F; 483.1 K)","Explosive limits":"0.8–2.6%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":">2 g kg−1 (dermal, rabbit)\n>5 g kg−1 (oral, rat)","Related alkanes":"Nonane\nUndecane","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
