{"name":"Thiazyl trifluoride","desc":"Thiazyl trifluoride is a chemical compound of nitrogen, sulfur, and fluorine, having the formula NSF3. It exists as a stable, colourless gas, and is an important precursor to other sulfur-nitrogen-fluorine compounds. It has tetrahedral molecular geometry around the sulfur atom, and is regarded to be a prime example of a compound that has a sulfur-nitrogen triple bond.","images":[{"alt":"Thiazyl-trifluoride-2D-dimensions.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Thiazyl-trifluoride-2D-dimensions.png/150px-Thiazyl-trifluoride-2D-dimensions.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Thiazyl_trifluoride","":"","CAS Number":"15930-75-3 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30507 Y","ChemSpider":"123471 Y","PubChem CID":"140008","Chemical formula":"NSF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"103.07 g mol−1","Melting point":"−72.6 °C (−98.7 °F; 200.6 K)","Boiling point":"−27.1 °C (−16.8 °F; 246.1 K)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
