{"name":"Oxalic acid","desc":"Oxalic acid is an organic compound with the formula C2H2O4. It is a colorless crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water. Its condensed formula is HOOCCOOH, reflecting its classification as the simplest dicarboxylic acid. Its acid strength is much greater than that of acetic acid. Oxalic acid is a reducing agent  and its conjugate base, known as oxalate (C\n2O2−\n4), is a chelating agent for metal cations. Typically, oxalic acid occurs as the dihydrate with the formula C2H2O4·2H2O. Excessive ingestion of oxalic acid or prolonged skin contact can be dangerous.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of oxalic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Oxals%C3%A4ure3.svg/140px-Oxals%C3%A4ure3.svg.png"},{"alt":"Skeletal formula of oxalic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Oxalic_acid_3D_ball.png/120px-Oxalic_acid_3D_ball.png"},{"alt":"Oxalic acid dihydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Oxalic_acid_dihyrate.JPG/200px-Oxalic_acid_dihyrate.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Oxalic_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Oxalic acid[1]\nOxalic acid[1]","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"Ethanedioic acid[1]\nEthanedioic acid[1]","Other names":"Wood bleach","CAS Number":"144-62-7 (anhydrous) Y\n6153-56-6 (dihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","3DMet":"B00059","Beilstein Reference":"385686","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16995 Y","ChemSpider":"946 Y","DrugBank":"DB03902 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.123","EC Number":"205-634-3","Gmelin Reference":"2208","KEGG":"C00209 N","MeSH":"Oxalic+acid","PubChem CID":"971","RTECS number":"RO2450000","UNII":"9E7R5L6H31 Y","UN number":"3261","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"90.03 g·mol−1\n(anhydrous)\n126.065 g mol−1 (dihydrate)","Appearance":"White crystals","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.90 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.653 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (dihydrate)","Melting point":"189 to 191 °C (372 to 376 °F; 462 to 464 K)\n101.5 °C (214.7 °F; 374.6 K) dihydrate","Solubility in water":"143 g/L (25 °C)","Solubility":"237 g/L (15 °C) in ethanol\n\n14 g/L (15 °C) in diethyl ether [2]","Vapor pressure":"<0.001 mmHg (20 °C)[3]","Acidity (pKa)":"1.25, 4.14[4]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-60.05·10−6 cm3/mol","ATCvet code":"QP53AG03 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Toxicity","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"1\n3\n0","Flash point":"166 °C (331 °F; 439 K)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LDLo (lowest published)":"1000 mg/kg (dog, oral)\n1400 mg/kg (rat)\n7500 mg/kg (rat, oral)[5]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[3]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 ST 2 mg/m3[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"500 mg/m3[3]","Related compounds":"oxalyl chloride\ndisodium oxalate\ncalcium oxalate\nphenyl oxalate ester","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
