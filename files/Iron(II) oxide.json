{"name":"Iron(II) oxide","desc":"Iron(II) oxide or ferrous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula FeO. Its mineral form is known as wüstite. One of several iron oxides, it is a black-colored powder that is sometimes confused with rust, which consists of hydrated iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide). Iron(II) oxide also refers to a family of related non-stoichiometric compounds, which are typically iron deficient with compositions ranging from Fe0.84O to Fe0.95O.","images":[{"alt":"Iron(II) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Iron%28II%29_oxide.jpg/200px-Iron%28II%29_oxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Manganese(II)-oxide-xtal-3D-SF.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Manganese%28II%29-oxide-xtal-3D-SF.png/200px-Manganese%28II%29-oxide-xtal-3D-SF.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron_monoxide","IUPAC name":"Iron(II) oxide","Other names":"Ferrous oxide,iron monoxide","CAS Number":"1345-25-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:50820 Y","ChemSpider":"14237 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.014.292","Gmelin Reference":"13590","PubChem CID":"14945","UNII":"G7036X8B5H Y","Chemical formula":"FeO","Molar mass":"71.844 g/mol","Appearance":"black crystals","Density":"5.745 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,377 °C (2,511 °F; 1,650 K)[1]","Boiling point":"3,414 °C (6,177 °F; 3,687 K)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Solubility":"insoluble in alkali, alcohol\ndissolves in acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+7200·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.23","Main hazards":"can be pyrophoric","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0793","NFPA 704":"0\n0","Autoignition\ntemperature":"variable","Other anions":"iron(II) fluoride, iron(II) sulfide, iron(II) selenide, iron(II) telluride","Other cations":"manganese(II) oxide, cobalt(II) oxide","Related compounds":"Iron(III) oxide, Iron(II,III) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
