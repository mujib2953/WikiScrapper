{"name":"Selenic acid","desc":"Selenic acid is the inorganic compound with the formula H\n2SeO\n4. It is an oxoacid of selenium, and its structure is more accurately described as (HO)\n2SeO\n2. It is a colorless compound. Although it has few uses, its derivative sodium selenate is used in the production of glass and animal feeds.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of selenic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Selenic-acid-2D.png/100px-Selenic-acid-2D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Selenic_acid","":"","IUPAC name":"Selenic(VI) acid","Other names":"Selenic acid","CAS Number":"7783-08-6 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18170 Y","ChemSpider":"1058 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.072","KEGG":"C05697 Y","PubChem CID":"1089","RTECS number":"VS6575000","UNII":"HV0Y51NC4J N","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">H<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span>SeO<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n4</span></span>","Molar mass":"144.9734 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless deliquescent crystals","Density":"2.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"58 °C (136 °F; 331 K)","Boiling point":"260 °C (500 °F; 533 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"130 g/100 mL (30 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"-3, 1.9[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−51.2·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.5174 (D-line, 20 °C)","Molecular shape":"tetrahedral at Se","Main hazards":"Corrosive, highly toxic","R-phrases (outdated)":"23/25-33-50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"20/21-28-45-60-61","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2\nOX","Other anions":"selenious acid\nhydrogen selenide","Other cations":"sodium selenate","Related compounds":"Sulfuric acid\nSelenium dioxide\nSelenium trioxide\nTelluric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
