{"name":"Caesium hydroxide","desc":"Caesium hydroxide (CsOH) is a chemical compound consisting of an ion of caesium and a hydroxide ion. It is a strong base (pKb=-1.76), much like the other alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. In fact, caesium hydroxide is powerful enough to quickly corrode through glass.","images":[{"alt":"Cesium hydroxide monohydrate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Cesium_hydroxide_monohydrate.jpg/200px-Cesium_hydroxide_monohydrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Caesium_hydroxide","Other names":"Caesium hydrate","CAS Number":"21351-79-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33988 Y","ChemSpider":"56494 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.040.298","EC Number":"244-344-1","RTECS number":"FK9800000","UN number":"2682","Chemical formula":"CsOH","Molar mass":"149.912 g/mol","Appearance":"Whitish-yellow deliquescent crystals","Density":"3.675 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"272 °C (522 °F; 545 K)[3]","Solubility in water":"300 g/100 mL at 30 °C","Solubility":"Soluble in ethanol[1]","Basicity (pKb)":"−0.8[2](CsOH(aq) = Cs+ + OH–)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"69.9 J·mol−1·K−1[4]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"104.2 J·K−1·mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−416.2 kJ·mol−1","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1592","Flash point":"Not flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"570 mg/kg (oral, rat)[6]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[5]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 2 mg/m3[5]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[5]","Other anions":"Caesium oxide\nCaesium fluoride","Other cations":"Lithium hydroxide\nSodium hydroxide\nPotassium hydroxide\nRubidium hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
