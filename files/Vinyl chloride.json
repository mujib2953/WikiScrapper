{"name":"Vinyl chloride","desc":"Vinyl chloride is an organochloride with the formula H2C=CHCl that is also called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) or chloroethene. This colorless compound is an important industrial chemical chiefly used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). About 13 billion kilograms are produced annually. VCM is among the top twenty largest petrochemicals (petroleum-derived chemicals) in world production. The United States currently remains the largest VCM manufacturing region because of its low-production-cost position in chlorine and ethylene raw materials. China is also a large manufacturer and one of the largest consumers of VCM. Vinyl chloride is a gas with a sweet odor. It is highly toxic, flammable, and carcinogenic. It can be formed in the environment when soil organisms break down \"chlorinated\" solvents. Vinyl chloride that is released by industries or formed by the breakdown of other chlorinated chemicals can enter the air and drinking water supplies. Vinyl chloride is a common contaminant found near landfills. In the past VCM has been used as a refrigerant.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of vinyl chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Vinyl-chloride-2D.png/100px-Vinyl-chloride-2D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Vinyl_chloride","":"","IUPAC name":"Chloroethene","Other names":"Vinyl chloride monomer\nVCM\nChloroethylene\nRefrigerant-1140","CAS Number":"75-01-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28509 Y","ChemSpider":"6098 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.756","KEGG":"C06793 Y","PubChem CID":"6338","Appearance":"Colorless gas","Odor":"pleasant[1]","Density":"0.911&#xA0;g/ml","Melting point":"−153.8 °C (−244.8 °F; 119.3 K)","Boiling point":"−13.4 °C (7.9 °F; 259.8 K)","Solubility in water":"2.7 g/L (0.0432 mol/L)","Vapor pressure":"2580 mm. of mercury 20 °C (68 °F)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-35.9·10−6 cm3/mol","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"0.8592 J/K/g (gas)\n0.9504 J/K/g (solid)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−94.12 kJ/mol (solid)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"F+  T","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12, R45","S-phrases (outdated)":"S45, S53","NFPA 704":"4\n3\n2","Flash point":"−61 °C (−78 °F; 212 K)","Explosive limits":"3.6%-33%[1]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 ppm C 5 ppm [15-minute][1]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [N.D.][1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
