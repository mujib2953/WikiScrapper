{"name":"Nickel(II) carbonate","desc":"Nickel(II) carbonate describes one or a mixture of inorganic compounds containing nickel and carbonate. From the industrial perspective, the most important nickel carbonate is basic nickel carbonate with the formula Ni4CO3(OH)6(H2O)4. Simpler carbonates, ones more likely encountered in the laboratory, are NiCO3 and its hexahydrate. All are paramagnetic green solid containing Ni2+ cations. The basic carbonate is an intermediate in the hydrometallurgical purification of nickel from its ores and is used in electroplating of nickel.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel(II) carbonate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Nickel_carbonate_basic.jpg/200px-Nickel_carbonate_basic.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel(II)_carbonate","IUPAC name":"Nickel(II) carbonate","Other names":"Nickelous carbonate","CAS Number":"3333-67-3 N\n29863-10-3 (Ni4CO3(OH)6(H2O)4) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"17701 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.020.063","EC Number":"222-068-2","PubChem CID":"18746","RTECS number":"QR6200000","UN number":"3288","Chemical formula":"NiCO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"118.7","Appearance":"light green powder","Density":"4.39 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"205 °C (401 °F; 478 K)\ndecomposes[1]","Solubility in water":"0.0093 g/100ml","Solubility product (Ksp)":"6.6·10−9","Crystal structure":"rhombohedral","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0927","GHS pictograms":"[2]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H302, H312, H332, H315, H317, H319, H334, H335, H350[2]","GHS precautionary statements":"P201, P261, P280, P305+351+338, P308+313[2]","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"840 mg/kg","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
