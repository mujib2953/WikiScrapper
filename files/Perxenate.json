{"name":"Perxenate","desc":"In chemistry, perxenates are salts of the yellow xenon-containing anion XeO4−\n6. This anion has octahedral molecular geometry, as determined by Raman spectroscopy, having O–Xe–O bond angles varying between 87° and 93°. The Xe–O bond length was determined by X-ray crystallography to be 1.875 Å.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Perxenate#Perxenic_acid"}
