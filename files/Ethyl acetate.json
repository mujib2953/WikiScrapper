{"name":"Ethyl acetate","desc":"Ethyl acetate (systematically ethyl ethanoate, commonly abbreviated EtOAc or EA) is the organic compound with the formula CH3–COO–CH2–CH3, simplified to C4H8O2. This colorless liquid has a characteristic sweet smell (similar to pear drops) and is used in glues, nail polish removers, decaffeinating tea and coffee, and cigarettes (see list of additives in cigarettes). Ethyl acetate is the ester of ethanol and acetic acid; it is manufactured on a large scale for use as a solvent. The combined annual production in 1985 of Japan, North America, and Europe was about 400,000 tonnes. In 2004, an estimated 1.3 million tonnes were produced worldwide.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Ethyl_acetate2.svg/160px-Ethyl_acetate2.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Ethyl-acetate-3D-balls.png/200px-Ethyl-acetate-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ethyl_acetate","Preferred IUPAC name":"Ethyl acetate\nEthyl acetate","Systematic IUPAC name":"Ethyl ethanoate\nEthyl ethanoate","Other names":"Acetic ester\nAcetic ether\nEthyl ester of acetic acid\n\n\n\n\nAcetic ester\nAcetic ether\nEthyl ester of acetic acid","CAS Number":"141-78-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"506104","ChEBI":"CHEBI:27750 Y","ChemSpider":"8525 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.001","E number":"E1504 (additional chemicals)","Gmelin Reference":"26306","KEGG":"D02319 Y","PubChem CID":"8857","RTECS number":"AH5425000","UNII":"76845O8NMZ Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"88.11 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Ether-like, fruity[1]","Density":"0.902&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−83.6 °C (−118.5 °F; 189.6 K)","Boiling point":"77.1 °C (170.8 °F; 350.2 K)","Solubility in water":"8.3 g/100 mL (at 20 °C)","Solubility in ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether, benzene":"Miscible","Vapor pressure":"73 mmHg (9.7 kPa) at 20 °C[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"25","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"3004459000000000000♠−54.10×10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3720","Viscosity":"426 μPa·s (0.426 cP) at 25 °C","Dipole moment":"1.78 D","Main hazards":"Flammable (F),\nIrritant (Xi)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","R-phrases (outdated)":"R11, R36, R66, R67","S-phrases (outdated)":"S16, S26, S33","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"−4 °C (25 °F; 269 K)","Explosive limits":"2.0–11.5%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"11.3 g/kg, rat","LC50 (median concentration)":"16,000 ppm (rat, 6 h)\n12,295 ppm (mouse, 2 h)\n1600 ppm (rat, 8 h)[2]","LCLo (lowest published)":"21 ppm (guinea pig, 1 h)\n12,330 ppm (mouse, 3 h)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 400 ppm (1400 m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 400 ppm (1400 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"2000 ppm[1]","Related carboxylate esters":"Methyl acetate,\nPropyl acetate,\nButyl acetate","Related compounds":"Acetic acid,\nEthanol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
