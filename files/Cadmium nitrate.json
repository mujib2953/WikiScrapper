{"name":"Cadmium nitrate","desc":"Cadmium nitrate describes any of the related members of a family of inorganic compound with the general formula Cd(NO3)2.xH2O. The anhydrous form is volatile but the others are salts. All are colourless crystalline solids that absorb moisture from air and becomes watery, that is deliquescent. Cadmium compounds are also known to be carcinogenic.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of cadmium chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Cadmium_nitrate.png/160px-Cadmium_nitrate.png"},{"alt":"Crystal of cadmium chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Dusi%C4%8Dnan_kademnat%C3%BD.JPG/200px-Dusi%C4%8Dnan_kademnat%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_nitrate","IUPAC name":"Cadmium(II) nitrate","Other names":"Nitric acid, cadmium salt","CAS Number":"10325-94-7 Y\n10022-68-1 (tetrahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:77732 N","ChemSpider":"23498 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.166.363","EC Number":"233-710-6","UNII":"VF9RQV8VXV N","UN number":"3087","Chemical formula":"Cd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"236,42","Appearance":"White crystals, hygroscopic","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"3.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahdyrate)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"360 °C (680 °F; 633 K)\nat 760 mmHg (anhydrous)\n59.5 °C (139.1 °F; 332.6 K)\nat 760 mmHg (tetrahydrate)[1]","Boiling point":"132 °C (270 °F; 405 K)\nat 760 mmHg (tetrahydrate)[2]","Solubility in water":"109.7 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n126.6 g/100 mL (18 °C)\n139.8 g/100 mL (30 °C)\n320.9 g/100 mL (59.5 °C)[3]","Solubility":"Soluble in acids, ammonia, alcohols, ether, acetone\n5 g/L in methanol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−5.51·10−5 cm3/mol (anhydrous)\n−1.4·10−4 cm3/mol (tetrahydrate)[1]","Crystal structure":"Cubic (anhydrous)\nOrthorhombic (tetrahydrate)[1]","Space group":"Fdd2, No. 43 (tetrahydrate)[4]","Point group":"mm2 (tetrahydrate)[4]","Lattice constant":"α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°","GHS pictograms":"[5]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H301, H330, H340, H350, H360, H372, H410[5]","GHS precautionary statements":"P201, P260, P273, P284, P301+310, P310[5]","NFPA 704":"[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n1\nOX","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"300 mg/kg (rats, oral)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"[1910.1027] TWA 0.005 mg/m3 (as Cd)[6]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca[6]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [9 mg/m3 (as Cd)][6]","Other anions":"Cadmium acetate\nCadmium chloride\nCadmium sulfate","Other cations":"Zinc nitrate\nCalcium nitrate\nMagnesium nitrate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
