{"name":"Iron(II) hydroxide","desc":"Iron(II) hydroxide or ferrous hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula Fe(OH)2. It is produced when iron(II) salts, from a compound such as iron(II) sulfate, are treated with hydroxide ions. Iron(II) hydroxide is a white solid, but even traces of oxygen impart a greenish tinge. The air-oxidized solid is sometimes known as \"green rust\".","images":[{"alt":"Iron(II) hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg/200px-Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron(II)_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Iron(II) hydroxide","Other names":"Ferrous hydroxide","CAS Number":"18624-44-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8305416 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.038.581","PubChem CID":"10129897","UNII":"7JIM5W32UU Y","Chemical formula":"Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"89.86 g/mol","Appearance":"green solid","Density":"3.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Solubility in water":"0.72 g/100 mL (25 °C, pH 7)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"8.0 x 10−16[2]","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Related compounds":"Iron(II) oxide\nIron(III) hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
