{"name":"Sodium bisulfate","desc":"Sodium bisulfate, also known as sodium hydrogen sulfate, is the sodium salt of the bisulfate anion, with the molecular formula NaHSO4. Sodium bisulfate is an acid salt formed by partial neutralization of sulfuric acid by an equivalent of sodium base, typically either in the form of sodium hydroxide or sodium chloride. It is a dry granular product that can be safely shipped and stored. The anhydrous form is hygroscopic. Solutions of sodium bisulfate are acidic, with a 1M solution having a pH of around 1.","images":[{"alt":"One sodium cation and one hydrogensulfate anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Sodium_bisulfate.svg/100px-Sodium_bisulfate.svg.png"},{"alt":"Sodium bisulfate, as a white powder, turns indicator paper red.","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Sodium_Bisulfate.jpg/150px-Sodium_Bisulfate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_bisulfate","":"","IUPAC name":"Sodium hydrogen sulfate","Other names":"Sodium acid sulfate\nBisulfate of soda","CAS Number":"7681-38-1 Y\n10034-88-5 (monohydrate) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56397 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.787","EC Number":"231-665-7","E number":"E514 (acidity regulators, ...)","PubChem CID":"516919","RTECS number":"VZ1860000","Chemical formula":"NaHSO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"120.06 g/mol (anhydrous)\n138.07 g/mol (monohydrate)","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"2.742 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (monohydrate)","Melting point":"58.5 °C (137.3 °F; 331.6 K) (monohydrate)\n315 °C (anhydrous)","Boiling point":"decomposes to Na2S2O7 (+ H2O) at 315 °C (599 °F; 588 K)","Solubility in water":"28.5 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n100 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"Insoluble in ammonia","Acidity (pKa)":"1.99","Crystal structure":"triclinic (anhydrous)\nmonoclinic (monohydrate)","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"R34 R37 R41","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26 S36 S37 S39 S45","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Sodium sulfate","Other cations":"Potassium bisulfate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
