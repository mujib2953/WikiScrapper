{"name":"Isopropyl alcohol","desc":"Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol), also called dimethyl carbinol or, incorrectly, isopropanol, is a compound with the chemical formula C3H8O or C3H7OH or CH3CHOHCH3 (sometimes represented as i-PrOH). It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor. As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH3)2CHOH. It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol. It has a wide variety of industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of isopropyl alcohol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/2-Propanol.svg/100px-2-Propanol.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Isopropanol","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Propan-2-ol\nPropan-2-ol","[1]Rubbing alcohol":"2-Propanol\nIsopropanol (incorrect[1])\nRubbing alcohol\nsec-Propyl alcohol\ns-Propanol\niPrOH\nDimethyl carbinol\nIPA","CAS Number":"67-63-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"635639","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17824 Y","ChemSpider":"3644 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.601","Gmelin Reference":"1464","KEGG":"D00137 Y","PubChem CID":"3776","RTECS number":"NT8050000","UNII":"ND2M416302 Y","UN number":"1219","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"60.10 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Density":"0.786 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−89 °C (−128 °F; 184 K)","Boiling point":"82.6 °C (180.7 °F; 355.8 K)","Solubility in water":"miscible in water","Solubility":"miscible in benzene, chloroform, ethanol, ether, glycerin\nsoluble in acetone","Acidity (pKa)":"16.5[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-45.794·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3776","Viscosity":"2.86 cP at 15 °C\n1.96 cP at 25 °C[3]\n1.77 cP at 30 °C[3]","Dipole moment":"1.66 D (gas)","ATC code":"D08AX05 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Flammable","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nExternal MSDS","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H319, H336","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P261, P305+351+338","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"Open cup: 11.7 °C (53.1 °F; 284.8 K)\nClosed cup: 13 °C (55 °F)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"399 °C (750 °F; 672 K)","Explosive limits":"2–12.7%","Threshold limit value":"980 mg/m3 (TWA), 1225 mg/m3 (STEL)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"12800 mg/kg (dermal, rabbit)[citation needed]\n3600 mg/kg (oral, mouse)\n5045 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n6410 mg/kg (oral, rabbit)[5]","LC50 (median concentration)":"53000 mg/m3 (inhalation, mouse)[citation needed]\n12,000 ppm (rat, 8 hr)[5]","LCLo (lowest published)":"16,000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n12,800 ppm (mouse, 3 hr)[5]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 400 ppm (980 mg/m3)[4]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 400 ppm (980 mg/m3) ST 500 ppm (1225 mg/m3)[4]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"2000 ppm[4]","Related alcohols":"1-Propanol, ethanol, 2-butanol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
