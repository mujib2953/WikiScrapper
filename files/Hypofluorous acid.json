{"name":"Hypofluorous acid","desc":"Hypofluorous acid, HOF, is the only known oxoacid of fluorine. It is also the only hypohalous acid that can be isolated as a solid. HOF is an intermediate in the oxidation of water by fluorine, which produces hydrogen fluoride, oxygen difluoride, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and oxygen. HOF is explosive at room temperature, forming HF and O2:","images":[{"alt":"Hypofluorous acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Hypofluorous-acid-2D-dimensions.png/200px-Hypofluorous-acid-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Hypofluorous acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Hypofluorous-acid-3D-vdW.png/200px-Hypofluorous-acid-3D-vdW.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hypofluorous_acid","IUPAC name":"Hypofluorous acid","Other names":"Hydrogen hypofluorite\nHydrogen fluorate(I)\nFluoric(-I) acid\nHydrogen monofluoroxygenate(0)","CAS Number":"14034-79-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"109936 N","PubChem CID":"123334","Chemical formula":"HOF","Molar mass":"36.0057 g mol−1","Appearance":"pale yellow liquid above −117 °C\nwhite solid below −117 °C","Melting point":"−117 °C (−179 °F; 156 K)","Boiling point":"< 0 °C\ndecomposes at 0 °C","Point group":"Cs","Other cations":"lithium hypofluorite, LiOF","Related compounds":"hypochlorous acid, HOCl","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
