{"name":"Cerium hexaboride","desc":"Cerium hexaboride (CeB6, also called cerium boride, CeBix, CEBIX, and (incorrectly) CeB) is an inorganic chemical, a boride of cerium. It is a refractory ceramic material. It has low work function and one of the highest electron emissivity known, and is stable in vacuum. The principal use of cerium hexaboride is a coating of hot cathodes, or hot cathodes made of cerium hexaboride crystals. It usually operates at temperature of 1450 °C.","images":[{"alt":"CaHexaboride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/CaHexaboride.jpg/200px-CaHexaboride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Cerium_boride","Other names":"cerium boride, ceBIX, CEBIX","CAS Number":"12008-02-5 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.375","EC Number":"234-526-9","Chemical formula":"CeB<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"204.986 g/mol","Density":"4.80 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,552 °C; 4,625 °F; 2,825 K","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Crystal structure":"Cubic","Space group":"Pm3m ; Oh","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
