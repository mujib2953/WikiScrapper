{"name":"Tantalum(V) chloride","desc":"Tantalum(V) chloride, also known as tantalum pentachloride, is an inorganic compound with the formula TaCl5. It takes the form of a white powder and is commonly used as a starting material in tantalum chemistry. It readily hydrolyzes to form tantalum(V) oxychloride (TaOCl3) and eventually tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5); this requires that it be synthesised and manipulated under anhydrous conditions, using air-free techniques.","images":[{"alt":"TaCl5structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/TaCl5structure.jpg/200px-TaCl5structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Tantalum(V)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Tantalum(V) chloride\nTantalum pentachloride","CAS Number":"7721-01-9 TaCl5 N\n17499-29-5 Ta2Cl10 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.869","EC Number":"231-755-6","PubChem CID":"24394","UNII":"9WXV40ZI4M N","Chemical formula":"TaCl<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"358.213 g/mol","Appearance":"white monoclinic crystals[1]","Density":"3.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"216 °C (421 °F; 489 K)","Boiling point":"239.4 °C (462.9 °F; 512.5 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"reacts","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, ether, CCl4","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+140.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic, mS72","Space group":"C2/m, No. 12","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"221.75 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-858.98 kJ/mol","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1900 mg/kg (oral, rat)","Other anions":"Tantalum(V) fluoride\nTantalum(V) bromide\nTantalum(V) iodide","Other cations":"Vanadium(IV) chloride\nNiobium(V) chloride","Related compounds":"Tantalum(III) chloride, Tantalum(IV) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
