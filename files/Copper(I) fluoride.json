{"name":"Copper(I) fluoride","desc":"Copper(I) fluoride or Cuprous fluoride is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula CuF. Its existence is uncertain. It was reported in 1933 to have a sphalerite-type crystal structure. Modern textbooks state that CuF is not known, since fluorine is so electronegative that it will always oxidise copper to its +2 oxidation state. Complexes of CuF such as [(Ph3P)3CuF] are, however, known and well characterised.","images":[{"alt":"Unit cell, ball and stick model of copper(I) fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Copper%28I%29-fluoride-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/120px-Copper%28I%29-fluoride-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(I)_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Copper(I) fluoride","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"Fluorocopper[1]\nFluorocopper[1]","Other names":"Cuprous fluoride","CAS Number":"13478-41-6 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"2341261 Y","PubChem CID":"3084153","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Copper\">Cu</span><span title=\"Fluorine\">F</span>","Molar mass":"82.54 g·mol−1","Density":"7.1 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Crystal structure":"sphalerite","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
