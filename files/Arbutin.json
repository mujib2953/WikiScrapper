{"name":"Arbutin","desc":"Arbutin is a glycoside; a glycosylated hydroquinone extracted from the bearberry plant in the genus Arctostaphylos. It inhibits tyrosinase and thus prevents the formation of melanin. Arbutin is therefore used as a skin-lightening agent. Arbutin is found in wheat, and is concentrated in pear skins. It is also found in Bergenia crassifolia. Arbutin was also produced by an in vitro culture of Schisandra chinensis.","images":[{"alt":"Arbutin structure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Arbutin_structure.svg/200px-Arbutin_structure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Arbutin","IUPAC name":"(2R,3S,4S,5R,6S)-2-Hydroxymethyl-6- (4-hydroxyphenoxy)oxane-3,4,5-triol","Other names":"Arbutoside\nHydroquinone β-D-glucopyranoside","CAS Number":"497-76-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18305 N","ChemSpider":"389765 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.138","PubChem CID":"346","RTECS number":"CE8663000","UNII":"C5INA23HXF Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>12</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>16</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>7</sub>","Molar mass":"272.25 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless to white powder","Melting point":"199.5 °C (391.1 °F; 472.6 K)","Boiling point":"561.6","Solubility in water":"5.0 g/100 mL","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol\nslightly soluble in ethyl ether\ninsoluble in benzene, chloroform, carbon disulfide","log P":"-1.35","Vapor pressure":"almost 0 (25 °C)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-158.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Safety data sheet":"Sigma-Aldrich","NFPA 704":"0\n0\n0","Flash point":"293.4 °C (560.1 °F; 566.5 K)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
