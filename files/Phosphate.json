{"name":"Phosphate","desc":"A phosphate (PO3−\n4) is an inorganic chemical and a salt of phosphoric acid. In organic chemistry, a phosphate, or organophosphate, is an ester of phosphoric acid. Of the various phosphoric acids and phosphates, organic phosphates are important in biochemistry and biogeochemistry (ecology), and inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry. At elevated temperatures in the solid state, phosphates can condense to form pyrophosphates.","images":[{"alt":"Stereo skeletal formula of phosphate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Phosphat-Ion.svg/140px-Phosphat-Ion.svg.png"},{"alt":"Aromatic ball and stick model of phosphate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Phosphate-3D-balls.png/100px-Phosphate-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Dihydrogen_phosphate_ion","":"","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"Phosphate[1]\nPhosphate[1]","CAS Number":"14265-44-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image\nInteractive image","Beilstein Reference":"3903772","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18367 Y","ChemSpider":"1032 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.110.746","Gmelin Reference":"1997","MeSH":"Phosphates","PubChem CID":"1061","UNII":"NK08V8K8HR Y","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">PO<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\">3&#x2212;<br>\n4</span></span>","Molar mass":"94.9714 g mol−1","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
