{"name":"Dichlorine hexoxide","desc":"Dichlorine hexoxide is the chemical compound with the molecular formula Cl\n2O\n6, which is correct for its gaseous state. However, in liquid or solid form, this chlorine oxide ionizes into the dark red ionic compound chloryl perchlorate [ClO\n2]+[ClO\n4]−, which may be thought of as the mixed anhydride of chloric and perchloric acids.","images":[{"alt":"Dichlorine hexoxide.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Dichlorine_hexoxide.svg/260px-Dichlorine_hexoxide.svg.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the dichlorine hexoxide molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Dichlorine-hexoxide_molecule_spacefill.png/105px-Dichlorine-hexoxide_molecule_spacefill.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chlorine_trioxide","":"","IUPAC name":"Dichlorine hexoxide","Other names":"Chlorine trioxide; Chloryl perchlorate; Chlorine(V,VII) oxide","CAS Number":"12442-63-6 Y","Chemical formula":"Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"166.901 g/mol","Appearance":"red liquid","Density":"1.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"3.5 °C (38.3 °F; 276.6 K)","Boiling point":"200 °C (392 °F; 473 K)","Solubility in water":"Reacts","Main hazards":"oxidizer","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
