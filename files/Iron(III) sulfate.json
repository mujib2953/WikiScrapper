{"name":"Iron(III) sulfate","desc":"Iron(III) sulfate (or ferric sulfate), is the chemical compound with the formula Fe2(SO4)3, the sulfate of trivalent iron. Usually yellow, it is a rhombic crystalline salt and soluble in water at room temperature. It is used in dyeing as a mordant, and as a coagulant for industrial wastes. It is also used in pigments, and in pickling baths for aluminum and steel. Medically it is used as an astringent and styptic.","images":[{"alt":"Iron(III) sulfate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/S%C3%ADran_%C5%BEelezit%C3%BD.JPG/250px-S%C3%ADran_%C5%BEelezit%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Ferric_sulfate","IUPAC name":"Iron(III) sulfate","Other names":"Ferric sulfate\nSulfuric acid, iron(3+) salt (3:2)","CAS Number":"10028-22-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:53438 Y","ChemSpider":"23211 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.054","PubChem CID":"24826","RTECS number":"NO8505000","UNII":"4YKQ1X5E5Y N","Chemical formula":"Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"399.88 g/mol (anhydrous)\n489.96 g/mol (pentahydrate)\n562.00 g/mol (nonahydrate)","Appearance":"grayish-white crystals","Density":"3.097 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.898 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (pentahydrate)","Melting point":"480 °C (896 °F; 753 K) (anhydrous)\n175 °C (347 °F) (nonahydrate)","Solubility in water":"slightly soluble","Solubility":"sparingly soluble in alcohol\nnegligible in acetone, ethyl acetate\ninsoluble in sulfuric acid, ammonia","Refractive index (nD)":"1.814 (anhydrous)\n1.552 (nonahydrate)","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"500 mg/kg (oral, rat)","NIOSH":"","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[1]","Other anions":"Iron(III) chloride\nIron(III) nitrate","Related compounds":"Iron(II) sulfate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
