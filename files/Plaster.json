{"name":"Plaster","desc":"Plaster is a building material used for the protective and/or decorative coating of walls and ceilings and for moulding and casting decorative elements. In English \"plaster\" usually means a material used for the interiors of buildings, while \"render\" commonly refers to external applications. Another imprecise term used for the material is stucco, which is also often used for plasterwork that is worked in some way to produce relief decoration, rather than flat surfaces.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Plaster_of_paris"}
