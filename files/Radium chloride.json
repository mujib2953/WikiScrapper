{"name":"Radium chloride","desc":"Radium chloride (RaCl2) is a chemical compound of radium and chlorine, and the first radium compound isolated in a pure state. Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne used it in their original separation of radium from barium. The first preparation of radium metal was by the electrolysis of a solution of this salt using a mercury cathode.","images":[{"alt":"Radium Chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Radium_Chloride.png/120px-Radium_Chloride.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Radium_chloride","CAS Number":"10025-66-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"20138060 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.020","UNII":"KKO873WR2Z N","Chemical formula":"RaCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"296.094 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless solid[1]","Density":"4.9&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-k5_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-k5-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"900 °C (1,650 °F; 1,170 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"245 g/L (20 °C)[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
