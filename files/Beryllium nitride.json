{"name":"Beryllium nitride","desc":"Beryllium nitride, Be3N2, is a nitride of beryllium. It can be prepared from the elements at high temperature (1100–1500 °C), unlike Beryllium azide or BeN6, it decomposes in vacuum into beryllium and nitrogen. It is readily hydrolysed forming beryllium hydroxide and ammonia. It has two polymorphic forms cubic α-Be3N2 with a defect anti-fluorite structure, and hexagonal β-Be3N2. It reacts with silicon nitride, Si3N4 in a stream of ammonia at 1800–1900 °C to form BeSiN2.","images":[{"alt":"Tl2O3structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Tl2O3structure.jpg/200px-Tl2O3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Beryllium_nitride","CAS Number":"1304-54-7 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.757","Chemical formula":"Be<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"55.06 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow or white powder","Density":"2.71 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,200 °C (3,990 °F; 2,470 K)","Boiling point":"2,240 °C (4,060 °F; 2,510 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"decomposes","Solubility in [[acids, bases]]":"hydrolyzes","Crystal structure":"Cubic, cI80, SpaceGroup = Ia-3, No. 106 (α form)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.002 mg/m3\nC 0.005 mg/m3 (30 minutes), with a maximum peak of 0.025 mg/m3 (as Be)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca C 0.0005 mg/m3 (as Be)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [4 mg/m3 (as Be)][1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
