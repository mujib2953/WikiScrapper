{"name":"Nickel(II) iodide","desc":"Nickel(II) iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula NiI2. This paramagnetic black solid dissolves readily in water to give blue-green solutions of the aquo complexes. This blue-green colour is typical of hydrated nickel(II) compounds. Nickel iodides find some applications in homogeneous catalysis.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel(II) iodide hexahydrate, NiI2•6H2O","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Jodid_nikelnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Jodid_nikelnat%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"Nickel(II) iodide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Nickel%28II%29-iodide-xtal-3D-SF.png/200px-Nickel%28II%29-iodide-xtal-3D-SF.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel(II)_iodide","IUPAC name":"Nickel(II) iodide","Other names":"Nickelous iodide","CAS Number":"13462-90-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.319","PubChem CID":"26038","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Iodine\">I</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Nickel\">Ni</span>","Molar mass":"312.50 g·mol−1","Appearance":"iron-black solid (anhydrous)\nbluish-green solid (hexahydrate)","Density":"5.384 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"780 °C (1,440 °F; 1,050 K) (anhydrous)\n43 °C (hexahydrate, loses water)","Solubility in water":"124.2 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n188.2 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"alcohols","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+3875.0·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Other anions":"nickel(II) chloride, nickel(II) bromide, nickel(II) fluoride","Other cations":"cobalt iodide, copper iodide,","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
