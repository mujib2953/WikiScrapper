{"name":"Malonic acid","desc":"Malonic acid (IUPAC systematic name: propanedioic acid) is a dicarboxylic acid with structure CH2(COOH)2. The ionized form of malonic acid, as well as its esters and salts, are known as malonates. For example, diethyl malonate is malonic acid's diethyl ester. The name originates from the Greek word μᾶλον (malon) meaning 'apple'.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of malonic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Malons%C3%A4ure.svg/200px-Malons%C3%A4ure.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the malonic acid molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Malonic_acid_3D_ball.png/200px-Malonic_acid_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Malonic_acid","Preferred IUPAC name":"Propanedioic acid\nPropanedioic acid","Other names":"Malonic acid\nMethanedicarboxylic acid","CAS Number":"141-82-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30794 Y","ChemSpider":"844 Y","DrugBank":"DB02175 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.003","PubChem CID":"867","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"104.06 g·mol−1","Density":"1.619 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"135 to 137 °C (275 to 279 °F; 408 to 410 K) (decomposes)","Boiling point":"decomposes","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Acidity (pKa)":"pKa1 = 2.83[1]\npKa2 = 5.69[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-46.3·10−6 cm3/mol","Other anions":"malonate","Related carboxylic acids":"acetic acid\noxalic acid\npropionic acid\ntartronic acid\nacrylic acid\nbutyric acid\nsuccinic acid\nfumaric acid","Related compounds":"propanone\npropionaldehyde\npropanedial\ndimethyl malonate","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
