{"name":"Zinc chloride","desc":"Zinc chloride is the name of chemical compounds with the formula ZnCl2 and its hydrates. Zinc chlorides, of which nine crystalline forms are known, are colorless or white, and are highly soluble in water.[citation needed] ZnCl2 itself is hygroscopic and even deliquescent. Samples should therefore be protected from sources of moisture, including the water vapor present in ambient air. Zinc chloride finds wide application in textile processing, metallurgical fluxes, and chemical synthesis. No mineral with this chemical composition is known aside from the very rare mineral simonkolleite, Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O.","images":[{"alt":"Zinc chloride hydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Zinc_chloride.jpg/200px-Zinc_chloride.jpg"},{"alt":"Kristallstruktur Zinkchlorid.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Kristallstruktur_Zinkchlorid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Zinkchlorid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_chloride","IUPAC name":"Zinc chloride","Other names":"Zinc(II) chloride\nZinc dichloride\nButter of zinc","CAS Number":"7646-85-7 Anhydrous Y\n29426-92-4 Tetrahydrate N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:49976 Y","ChemSpider":"5525 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.720","EC Number":"231-592-0","PubChem CID":"3007855","RTECS number":"ZH1400000","UNII":"86Q357L16B Y","UN number":"2331","Chemical formula":"ZnCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"136.315 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystalline solid\nhygroscopic and very deliquescent","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.907 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"290 °C (554 °F; 563 K)[1]","Boiling point":"732 °C (1,350 °F; 1,005 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"432.0 g/ 100 g (25 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, glycerol and acetone","Solubility in alcohol":"430.0 g/100ml","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−65.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral, linear in the gas phase","ATC code":"B05XA12 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nCorrosive (C)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22, R34, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S26, S36/37/39, S45, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"350 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n350 mg/kg (mouse, oral)\n200 mg/kg (guinea pig, oral)\n1100 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n1250 mg/kg (mouse, oral)[3]","LC50 (median concentration)":"1260 mg/m3 (rat, 30 min)\n1180 mg-min/m3[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (fume)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 ST 2 mg/m3 (fume)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"50 mg/m3 (fume)[2]","Other anions":"Zinc fluoride\nZinc bromide\nZinc iodide","Other cations":"Cadmium chloride\nMercury(II) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
