{"name":"Iron(III) chloride","desc":"Iron(III) chloride, also called ferric chloride, is an industrial scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals depends on the viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.","images":[{"alt":"Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Iron%28III%29_chloride_hexahydrate.jpg/200px-Iron%28III%29_chloride_hexahydrate.jpg"},{"alt":"Iron(III) chloride anhydrate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Iron%28III%29_chloride_anhydrate.jpg/200px-Iron%28III%29_chloride_anhydrate.jpg"},{"alt":"Iron-trichloride-sheet-3D-polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Iron-trichloride-sheet-3D-polyhedra.png/100px-Iron-trichloride-sheet-3D-polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron(III)_chloride","":"","IUPAC names":"Iron(III) chloride\nIron trichloride","Other names":"Ferric chloride\nMolysite\nFlores martis","CAS Number":"7705-08-0 Y\n10025-77-1 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30808 Y","ChemSpider":"22792 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.846","EC Number":"231-729-4","PubChem CID":"24380","RTECS number":"LJ9100000","UNII":"U38V3ZVV3V N\n0I2XIN602U (hexahydrate) N","UN number":"1773 (anhydrous)\n2582 (aq. soln.)","Chemical formula":"FeCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"162.204 g/mol (anhydrous)\n270.295 g/mol (hexahydrate)[1]","Appearance":"green-black by reflected light; purple-red by transmitted light\nhexahydrate: yellow solid\naq. solutions: brown","Odor":"slight HCl","Density":"2.90 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.82 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"307.6 °C (585.7 °F; 580.8 K) (anhydrous)\n37 °C (99 °F; 310 K) (hexahydrate)[1]","Boiling point":"316 °C (601 °F; 589 K) (anhydrous, decomposes)[1]\n280 °C (536 °F; 553 K) (hexahydrate, decomposes)","Solubility in water":"912 g/L (anh. or hexahydrate, 25 °C)[1]","Solubility in acetone\nMethanol\nEthanol\nDiethyl ether[1]":"630 g/L (18 °C)\nhighly soluble\n830 g/L\nhighly soluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+13,450·10−6 cm3/mol[2]","Viscosity":"40% solution: 12 cP","Crystal structure":"Hexagonal, hR24","Space group":"R3, No. 148[3]","Lattice constant":"a = 0.6065 nm, b = 0.6065 nm, c = 1.742 nm\nα = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 120°","Formula units (Z)":"6","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1499","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H290, H302, H314, H318","GHS precautionary statements":"P234, P260, P264, P270, P273, P280, P301+312, P301+330+331, P303+361+353, P363, P304+340, P310, P321, P305+351+338","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[4]","Other anions":"Iron(III) fluoride\nIron(III) bromide","Other cations":"Iron(II) chloride\nManganese(II) chloride\nCobalt(II) chloride\nRuthenium(III) chloride","Related coagulants":"Iron(II) sulfate\nPolyaluminium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
