{"name":"Europium(III) oxide","desc":"Europium(III) oxide (Eu2O3), is a chemical compound of europium and oxygen. It is widely used as a red or blue phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. It is also an agent for the manufacture of fluorescent glass. Europium fluorescence is used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in Euro banknotes.","images":[{"alt":"Eu2O3.powder.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Eu2O3.powder.jpg/200px-Eu2O3.powder.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Europium(III)_oxide","CAS Number":"1308-96-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"3441840 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.787","PubChem CID":"159371","Chemical formula":"Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"351.926 g/mol","Appearance":"white to light-pink solid powder","Odor":"odorless","Density":"7.42 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,350 °C (4,260 °F; 2,620 K)[1]","Boiling point":"4,118 °C (7,444 °F; 4,391 K)","Solubility in water":"Negligible","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+10,100·10−6 cm3/mol","Thermal conductivity":"2.45 W/(m K)","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic, Cubic","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"5000 mg/kg (rat, oral)","Other anions":"Europium(III) chloride","Other cations":"Samarium(III) oxide, Gadolinium(III) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
