{"name":"Acrylonitrile","desc":"Acrylonitrile is an organic compound with the formula CH2CHCN. It is a colorless volatile liquid, although commercial samples can be yellow due to impurities. In terms of its molecular structure, it consists of a vinyl group linked to a nitrile. It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile. It is reactive and toxic at low doses. Acrylonitrile was first synthesized by the French chemist Charles Moureu (1863–1929) in 1893.","images":[{"alt":"Acrylonitrile-2D.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Acrylonitrile-2D.png/100px-Acrylonitrile-2D.png"},{"alt":"Acrylonitrile-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Acrylonitrile-3D-balls.png/100px-Acrylonitrile-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Acrylonitrile","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Prop-2-enenitrile\nProp-2-enenitrile","Vinylcyanide[1][1]":"Acrylonitrile\n2-Propenenitrile\nCyanoethene,\nVinyl cyanide (VCN)\nCyanoethylene[1]\nPropenenitrile[1]","CAS Number":"107-13-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28217 Y","ChemSpider":"7567 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.152","EC Number":"608-003-00-4","KEGG":"C01998 Y","PubChem CID":"7855","RTECS number":"AT5250000","UNII":"MP1U0D42PE Y","UN number":"1093","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span>","Molar mass":"53.06 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colourless liquid","Density":"0.81 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−84 °C (−119 °F; 189 K)","Boiling point":"77 °C (171 °F; 350 K)","Solubility in water":"70 g/L","Vapor pressure":"83 mmHg[1]","Main hazards":"flammable,\nreactive,\ntoxic,\npotential occupational carcinogen[1]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0092","NFPA 704":"3\n4\n2","Flash point":"−1 °C; 30 °F; 272 K","Autoignition\ntemperature":"471 °C (880 °F; 744 K)","Explosive limits":"3–17%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"500 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n313 ppm (mouse, 4 hr)\n425 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[2]","LCLo (lowest published)":"260 ppm (rabbit, 4 hr)\n575 ppm (guinea pig, 4 hr)\n636 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n452 ppm (human, 1 hr)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 2 ppm C 10 ppm [15-minute] [skin][1]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca TWA 1 ppm C 10 ppm [15-minute] [skin][1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"85 ppm[1]","Related compounds":"acrylic acid,\nacrolein","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
