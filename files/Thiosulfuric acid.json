{"name":"Thiosulfuric acid","desc":"Thiosulfuric acid is a sulfur oxoacid. The acid cannot be made by acidifying aqueous thiosulfate salt solutions as the acid readily decomposes in water. The decomposition products can include sulfur, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, polysulfanes, sulfuric acid and polythionates, depending on the exact reaction conditions. Anhydrous methods of producing the acid were developed by Carol Schmidt:","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Thioschwefels%C3%A4ure.svg/150px-Thioschwefels%C3%A4ure.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Thiosulfuric-acid-3D-balls-B.png/150px-Thiosulfuric-acid-3D-balls-B.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Thiosulfuric_acid","IUPAC name":"sulfurothioic O-acid","Other names":"thiosulfuric acid\ndihydroxidooxidosulfidosulfur","CAS Number":"13686-28-7 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29279 Y","ChemSpider":"22886 Y","PubChem CID":"24478","Chemical formula":"H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"114.14 g/mol","Melting point":"decomposes below 0 °C","Solubility in water":"decomposes","Acidity (pKa)":"0.6, 1.74","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
