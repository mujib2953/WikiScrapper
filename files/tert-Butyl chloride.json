{"name":"tert-Butyl chloride","desc":"tert-Butyl chloride is the organochloride with the formula (CH3)3CCl. It is a colorless, flammable liquid. It is sparingly soluble in water, with a tendency to undergo hydrolysis to the corresponding tert-butyl alcohol. It is produced industrially as a precursor to other organic compounds.","images":[{"alt":"Tert-butyl-chloride-2D-skeletal.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Tert-butyl-chloride-2D-skeletal.png/100px-Tert-butyl-chloride-2D-skeletal.png"}],"link":"/wiki/T-butyl_chloride","":"","IUPAC name":"2-chloro-2-methylpropane","Other names":"1,1-dimethylethyl chloride\n1-chloro-1,1-dimethylethane\nchlorotrimethylmethane\ntrimethylchloromethane\nt-butyl chloride","CAS Number":"507-20-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"10054 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.334","EC Number":"208-066-4","PubChem CID":"10486","RTECS number":"TX5040000","UN number":"1127","Chemical formula":"C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>Cl","Molar mass":"92.57 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Density":"0.851 g/mL","Melting point":"−26 °C (−15 °F; 247 K)","Boiling point":"51 °C (124 °F; 324 K)","Solubility in water":"Sparingly sol in water, miscible with alcohol and ether","Vapor pressure":"34.9 kPa (20 °C)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Flammable (F)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12, R36/37/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S7, S9, S16, S29, S33","NFPA 704":"3\n2\n0","Flash point":"−9 °C (16 °F; 264 K) (open cup)\n−23 °C (closed cup)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"540 °C (1,004 °F; 813 K)","Related alkyl halides":"tert-Butyl bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
