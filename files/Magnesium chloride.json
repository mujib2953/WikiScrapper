{"name":"Magnesium chloride","desc":"Magnesium chloride is the name for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl2 and its various hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.","images":[{"alt":"Magnesium chloride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Magnesium_chloride.jpg/200px-Magnesium_chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Magnesium_chloride","Other names":"Magnesium dichloride","CAS Number":"7786-30-3 Y\n7791-18-6 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:6636 Y","ChemSpider":"22987 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.176","E number":"E511 (acidity regulators, ...)","Gmelin Reference":"9305","PubChem CID":"24584","RTECS number":"OM2975000","Chemical formula":"MgCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"95.211 g/mol (anhydrous)\n203.31 g/mol (hexahydrate)","Appearance":"white or colourless crystalline solid","Density":"2.32 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.569 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)","Melting point":"714 °C (1,317 °F; 987 K) 117 °C (243 °F; 390 K) (hexahydrate)\non rapid heating: slow heating leads to decomposition from 300 °C (572 °F; 573 K)","Boiling point":"1,412 °C (2,574 °F; 1,685 K)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous 52.9 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n\n54.3 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n72.6 g/100 mL (100 °C)\n\nhexahydrate\n167 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Solubility":"slightly soluble in acetone, pyridine","Solubility in ethanol":"7.4 g/100 mL (30 °C)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−47.4·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.675 (anhydrous)\n1.569 (hexahydrate)","Crystal structure":"CdCl2","Coordination geometry":"(octahedral, 6-coordinate)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"71.09 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"89.88 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-641.1 kJ/mol","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-591.6 kJ/mol","ATC code":"A12CC01 (WHO) B05XA11 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0764","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36, R37, R38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26, S37, S39","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2800 mg/kg (oral, rat)","Other anions":"Magnesium fluoride\nMagnesium bromide\nMagnesium iodide","Other cations":"Beryllium chloride\nCalcium chloride\nStrontium chloride\nBarium chloride\nRadium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
