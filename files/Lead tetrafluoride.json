{"name":"Lead tetrafluoride","desc":"Lead tetrafluoride is a compound of lead and fluorine. The yellow solid (melting point 600 °C) is the only room-temperature stable tetrahalide of lead. Lead tetrafluoride is isostructural with tin(IV) fluoride and contains planar layers of octahedrally coordinated lead, where the octahedra share four corners and there are two terminal, unshared, fluorine atoms trans to one another.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Lead_tetrafluoride","IUPAC name":"Tetrafluoroplumbane","Other names":"Lead(IV) fluoride\nLead tetrafluoride\nTetrafluoridolead","CAS Number":"7783-59-7","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"109871","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.102","EC Number":"232-012-9","PubChem CID":"123258","Chemical formula":"PbF<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"283.194 g/mol [1]","Appearance":"white to beige crystals [2]","Density":"6,7 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>","Melting point":"600 °C (1,112 °F; 873 K)[4]"}
