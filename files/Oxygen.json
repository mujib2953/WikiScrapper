{"name":"Oxygen","desc":"Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.","images":[{"alt":"A transparent beaker containing a light blue fluid with gas bubbles","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Liquid_oxygen_in_a_beaker_4.jpg/250px-Liquid_oxygen_in_a_beaker_4.jpg"},{"alt":"Oxygen spectre.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Oxygen_spectre.jpg/220px-Oxygen_spectre.jpg"},{"alt":"Hydrogen (diatomic nonmetal)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Transparent.gif"}],"link":"/wiki/Oxygen","":"","nitrogen ← oxygen → fluorine":"‍"}
