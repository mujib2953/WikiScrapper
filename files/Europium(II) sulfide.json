{"name":"Europium(II) sulfide","desc":"Europium (II) sulfide is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula EuS. It is a black, air-stable powder. Europium possesses an oxidation state of +II in europium sulfide, whereas the lanthanides exhibit a typical oxidation state of +III. Its Curie temperature (Tc) is 16.6 K. Below this temperature EuS behaves like a ferromagnetic compound, and above it exhibits simple paramagnetic properties. EuS is stable up to 500 °C in air, when it begins to show signs of oxidation. In an inert environment it decomposes at 1470 °C.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png/200px-Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Europium_monosulfide","IUPAC name":"europium(II) sulfide","CAS Number":"12020-65-4 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.498","PubChem CID":"82809","Chemical formula":"EuS","Molar mass":"184.03 g/mol","Appearance":"black powder","Melting point":"2,250 °C (4,080 °F; 2,520 K)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+25,730;·10−6 cm3/mol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
