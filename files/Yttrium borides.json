{"name":"Yttrium borides","desc":"Yttrium boride refers to a crystalline material composed of different proportions of yttrium and boron, such as YB2, YB4, YB6, YB12, YB25, YB50 and YB66. They are all gray-colored, hard solids having high melting temperatures. The most common form is the yttrium hexaboride YB6. It exhibits superconductivity at relatively high temperature of 8.4 K and, similar to LaB6, is an electron cathode. Another remarkable yttrium boride is YB66. It has a large lattice constant (2.344 nm), high thermal and mechanical stability, and therefore is used as a diffraction grating for low-energy synchrotron radiation (1–2 keV).","images":[{"alt":"12008-32-1","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/CaHexaboride.png/200px-CaHexaboride.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Yttrium_boride","CAS Number":"12008-32-1 Y","Chemical formula":"YB<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"153.77","Appearance":"black powder","Density":"3.67 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-s1_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-s1-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"2,300 °C (4,170 °F; 2,570 K)[2]","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Crystal structure":"cubic, cP7","Space group":"Pm3m, No. 221[1]","Lattice constant":"a = 0.41132 nm[1]","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n0\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
