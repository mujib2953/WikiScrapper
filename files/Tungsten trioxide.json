{"name":"Tungsten trioxide","desc":"Tungsten(VI) oxide, also known as tungsten trioxide or tungstic anhydride, WO3, is a chemical compound containing oxygen and the transition metal tungsten. It is obtained as an intermediate in the recovery of tungsten from its minerals. Tungsten ores are treated with alkalis to produce WO3. Further reaction with carbon or hydrogen gas reduces tungsten trioxide to the pure metal.[citation needed]","images":[{"alt":"Sample of Tungsten(VI) Oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/TungstenOxideSmall.jpg/200px-TungstenOxideSmall.jpg"},{"alt":"Kristallstruktur Wolfram(VI)-oxid.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Kristallstruktur_Wolfram%28VI%29-oxid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Wolfram%28VI%29-oxid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tungsten(VI)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Tungsten trioxide","Other names":"Tungstic anhydride\nTungsten(VI) oxide\nTungstic oxide","CAS Number":"1314-35-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.848","PubChem CID":"14811","RTECS number":"YO7760000","Chemical formula":"WO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"231.84 g/mol","Appearance":"Canary yellow powder","Density":"7.16 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,473 °C (2,683 °F; 1,746 K)","Boiling point":"1,700 °C (3,090 °F; 1,970 K) approximation","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"slightly soluble in HF","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−15.8·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic, mP32, Space group P121/c1, No 14","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (WVI)\nTrigonal planar (O2– )","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Tungsten trisulfide","Other cations":"Chromium trioxide\nMolybdenum trioxide","Related tungsten oxides":"Tungsten(III) oxide\nTungsten(IV) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
