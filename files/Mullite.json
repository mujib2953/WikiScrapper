{"name":"Mullite","desc":"Mullite or porcelainite is a rare silicate mineral of post-clay genesis. It can form two stoichiometric forms 3Al2O32SiO2 or 2Al2O3 SiO2. Unusually, mullite has no charge balancing cations present. As a result, there are three different aluminium sites: two distorted tetrahedral and one octahedral.","images":[{"alt":"Osumilite, thick tabulars with Mullite - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Osumilite%2C_thick_tabulars_with_Mullite_-_Ochtendung%2C_Eifel%2C_Germany.jpg/260px-Osumilite%2C_thick_tabulars_with_Mullite_-_Ochtendung%2C_Eifel%2C_Germany.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Mullite"}
