{"name":"Lithium fluoride","desc":"Lithium fluoride is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula LiF. It is a colorless solid, that transitions to white with decreasing crystal size. Although odorless, lithium fluoride has a bitter-saline taste. Its structure is analogous to that of sodium chloride, but it is much less soluble in water. It is mainly used as a component of molten salts. Formation of LiF from the elements releases one of the highest energy per mass of reactants, only second to that of BeO.","images":[{"alt":"Lithium fluoride boule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/LiF-crystal.jPeG/120px-LiF-crystal.jPeG"},{"alt":"Lithium fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Lithium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png/120px-Lithium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lithium_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Lithium fluoride","CAS Number":"7789-24-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23007 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.229","EC Number":"232-152-0","PubChem CID":"224478","RTECS number":"OJ6125000","Chemical formula":"LiF","Molar mass":"25.939(2) g/mol","Appearance":"white powder or transparent crystals,\nhygroscopic","Density":"2.635 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"845 °C (1,553 °F; 1,118 K)","Boiling point":"1,676 °C (3,049 °F; 1,949 K)","Solubility in water":"0.127 g/100 mL (18 °C)\n0.134 g/100 mL (25 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in HF\ninsoluble in alcohol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−10.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3915","Crystal structure":"Cubic","Lattice constant":"a = 403.51 pm","Molecular shape":"Linear","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"1.604 J/(g K)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"1.376 J/(g K)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-616 kJ/mol","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"143 mg/kg (oral, rat)[1]","Other anions":"Lithium chloride\nLithium bromide\nLithium iodide\nLithium astatide","Other cations":"Sodium fluoride\nPotassium fluoride\nRubidium fluoride\nCaesium fluoride\nFrancium fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
