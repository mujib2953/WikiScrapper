{"name":"Gallium trichloride","desc":"Gallium trichloride is the chemical compound with the formula GaCl3. Solid gallium trichloride exists as a dimer with the formula Ga2Cl6. It is colourless and soluble in virtually all solvents, even alkanes, which is truly unusual for a metal halide. It is the main precursor to most derivatives of gallium and a reagent in organic synthesis.","images":[{"alt":"Gallium-trichloride-from-xtal-2004-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Gallium-trichloride-from-xtal-2004-3D-balls.png/200px-Gallium-trichloride-from-xtal-2004-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Gallium_trichloride","Other names":"Gallium(III) chloride, Trichlorogallium, Trichlorogallane","CAS Number":"13450-90-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"24229 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.268","PubChem CID":"26010","RTECS number":"LW9100000","UNII":"4Y6GQD4915 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Chlorine\">Cl</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Gallium\">Ga</span>","Molar mass":"176.07 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless crystals\ndeliquescent","Density":"2.47 g/cm<sup>3</sup><br>\n2.053 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at melting point","Melting point":"77.9 °C (172.2 °F; 351.0 K) (anhydrous)\n44.4 °C (hydrate)","Boiling point":"201 °C (394 °F; 474 K)","Solubility in water":"very soluble","Solubility":"soluble in benzene, CCl4, CS2","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−63.0·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"4700 mg/kg (rat, oral)","Other anions":"Gallium(III) fluoride\nGallium(III) bromide\nGallium(III) iodide","Other cations":"Aluminium chloride\nIndium(III) chloride\nThallium(III) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
