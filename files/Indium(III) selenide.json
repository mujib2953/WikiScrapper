{"name":"Indium(III) selenide","desc":"Indium(III) selenide is a compound of indium and selenium. It has potential for use in photovoltaic devices and it has been the subject of extensive research. The two most common phases, α and β, have a layered structure, while γ is a \"defect wurtzite structure.\" In all, there are five known forms (α, β, γ, δ, κ). The α- β phase transition is accompanied by a change in electrical conductivity. The band-gap of γ-In2Se3 is approximately 1.9 eV. The crystalline form of a sample can depend on the method of production, for example thin films of pure γ-In2Se3 have been produced from trimethylindium, InMe3, and hydrogen selenide, H2Se, using MOCVD techniques.
