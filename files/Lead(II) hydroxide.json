{"name":"Lead(II) hydroxide","desc":"Lead(II) hydroxide, Pb(OH)2, is a hydroxide of lead, with lead in oxidation state +2. It is doubtful that such a simple compound exists. Lead basic carbonate (PbCO3·2Pb(OH)2) or lead(II) oxide (PbO) is encountered in practice where lead hydroxide is expected. This has been a subject of considerable confusion in the past.","images":[{"alt":"Hydroxid olovnatý.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Hydroxid_olovnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Hydroxid_olovnat%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Lead(II)_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Lead(II) hydroxide","Other names":"lead hydroxide\nplumbous hydroxide","CAS Number":"[1] 1319-46-6[1] N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8035300 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.358","PubChem CID":"9859601","Chemical formula":"Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"241.21 g/mol","Appearance":"white amorphous powder","Density":"7.41 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"135 °C (275 °F; 408 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"0.0155 g/100 mL (20 °C)[3]","Solubility product (Ksp)":"1.42 x 10−20","Solubility":"soluble in dilute acid and alkalis;\ninsoluble in acetone and acetic acid","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"T","R-phrases (outdated)":"R25","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2) S20/21 S29/56 S45","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
