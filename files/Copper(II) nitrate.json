{"name":"Copper(II) nitrate","desc":"Copper(II) nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is an inorganic compound that forms a blue crystalline solid. Anhydrous copper nitrate forms deep blue-green crystals and sublimes in a vacuum at 150-200 °C. Copper nitrate also occurs as five different hydrates, the most common ones being the trihydrate and hexahydrate. These materials are more commonly encountered in commerce than in the laboratory.","images":[{"alt":"Copper(II)-nitrate-monomer-2D-dimensions.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Copper%28II%29-nitrate-monomer-2D-dimensions.png/200px-Copper%28II%29-nitrate-monomer-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Copper(II)-nitrate-trihydrate-sample.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Copper%28II%29-nitrate-trihydrate-sample.jpg/200px-Copper%28II%29-nitrate-trihydrate-sample.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(II)_nitrate_trihydrate","IUPAC name":"Copper(II) nitrate","Other names":"Cupric nitrate","CAS Number":"3251-23-8 Y\n10031-43-3 (trihydrate) N\n13478-38-1 (hexahydrate) N\n19004-19-4 (hemipentahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:78036 N","ChemSpider":"17582 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.019.853","PubChem CID":"18616","RTECS number":"GL7875000","UNII":"9TC879S2ZV Y","Chemical formula":"Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"187.5558 g/mol (anhydrous)\n241.60 g/mol (trihydrate)\n232.591 g/mol (hemipentahydrate)","Appearance":"blue crystals\nhygroscopic","Density":"3.05 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.32 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (trihydrate)<br>\n2.07 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)","Melting point":"256 °C (493 °F; 529 K) (anhydrous, decomposes)\n114.5 °C (trihydrate)\n26.4 °C (hexahydrate, decomposes)","Boiling point":"170 °C (338 °F; 443 K) (trihydrate, decomposes)","Solubility in water":"trihydrate:[1]\n381 g/100 mL (40 °C)\n666 g/100 mL (80 °C)\nhexahydrate:[1]\n243.7 g/100 mL (80 °C)","Solubility":"hydrates very soluble in ethanol, ammonia, water; insoluble in ethyl acetate","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+1570.0·10−6 cm3/mol (~3H2O)","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic (anhydrous)\nrhombohedral (hydrates)","Main hazards":"Irritant, Oxidizer","Safety data sheet":"Cu(NO3)2·3H2O","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n3\nOX","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","Other anions":"Copper(II) sulfate\nCopper(II) chloride","Other cations":"Nickel(II) nitrate\nZinc nitrate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
