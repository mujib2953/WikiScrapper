{"name":"Aluminium monochloride","desc":"Aluminium monochloride is the metal halide with the formula AlCl. This compound is produced as a step in the Alcan process to smelt aluminium from an aluminium-rich alloy. When the alloy is placed in a reactor that is heated to 1,300 °C and mixed with aluminium trichloride, a gas of aluminium monochloride is produced.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_monochloride","IUPAC namecitation needed":"Aluminium monochloride[citation needed]","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"Chloridoaluminium[1]\nChloridoaluminium[1]","citation needed":"Aluminium(I) chloride[citation needed]","CAS Number":"13595-81-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30131 Y","ChemSpider":"4514257 Y","PubChem CID":"5359282","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Aluminium\">Al</span><span title=\"Chlorine\">Cl</span>","Molar mass":"62.43 g·mol−1","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"227.95 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-51.46 kJ mol−1","Related compounds":"aluminium monofluoride\ngallium monofluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
