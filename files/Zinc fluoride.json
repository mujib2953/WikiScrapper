{"name":"Zinc fluoride","desc":"Zinc fluoride (ZnF2) is an inorganic chemical compound. It is encountered as the anydrous form and also as the tetrahydrate, ZnF2 · 4H2O (rhombohedral crystal structure). It has a high melting point and has the rutile structure containing 6 coordinate zinc, which suggests appreciable ionic character in its chemical bonding. Unlike the other zinc halides, ZnCl2, ZnBr2 and ZnI2, it is not very soluble in water.","images":[{"alt":"Zinc fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Zinc-fluoride-3D-balls.png/200px-Zinc-fluoride-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_fluoride","Other names":"Zinc difluoride","CAS Number":"7783-49-5 Y\n13986-18-0 (tetrahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22957 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.092","PubChem CID":"24551","RTECS number":"ZH3200000","Chemical formula":"ZnF<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"103.406 g/mol (anhydrous)\n175.45 g/mol (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"white needles\nhygroscopic","Density":"4.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.30 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahydrate)","Melting point":"872 °C (1,602 °F; 1,145 K) (anhydrous)\n100 °C, decomposes (tetrahydrate)","Boiling point":"1,500 °C (2,730 °F; 1,770 K) (anhydrous)","Solubility in water":".000052 g/100 mL (anhydrous)\n1.52 g/100 mL, 20 °C (tetrahydrate)","Solubility":"sparingly soluble in HCl, HNO3, ammonia","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−38.2·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"tetragonal (anhydrous), tP6","Space group":"P42/mnm, No. 136","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
