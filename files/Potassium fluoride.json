{"name":"Potassium fluoride","desc":"Potassium fluoride is the chemical compound with the formula KF. After hydrogen fluoride, KF is the primary source of the fluoride ion for applications in manufacturing and in chemistry. It is an alkali halide and occurs naturally as the rare mineral carobbiite. Solutions of KF will etch glass due to the formation of soluble fluorosilicates, although HF is more effective.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Potassium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png/200px-Potassium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Potassium fluoride","CAS Number":"7789-23-3 (anhydrous) Y\n13455-21-5 (dihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23006 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.228","EC Number":"232-151-5","PubChem CID":"522689","RTECS number":"TT0700000","UNII":"9082WG1G3F Y","Chemical formula":"KF","Molar mass":"58.0967 g/mol (anhydrous)\n94.1273 g/mol (dihydrate)","Appearance":"colourless","Density":"2.48 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"858 °C (1,576 °F; 1,131 K) (anhydrous)\n41 °C (dihydrate)\n19.3 °C (trihydrate)","Boiling point":"1,502 °C (2,736 °F; 1,775 K)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous:\n92 g/100 mL (18 °C)\n102 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n\ndihydrate:\n349.3 g/100 mL (18 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in HF\ninsoluble in alcohol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−23.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Toxic (T)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R23/24/25","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S26, S45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"245 mg/kg (oral, rat)[1]","Other anions":"Potassium chloride\nPotassium bromide\nPotassium iodide\nPotassium astatide","Other cations":"Lithium fluoride\nSodium fluoride\nRubidium fluoride\nCaesium fluoride\nFrancium fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
