{"name":"Iron(II) selenide","desc":"Iron(II) selenide refers to a number of inorganic compounds of ferrous iron and selenide (Se2−). The phase diagram of the system Fe–Se reveals the existence of several non-stoichiometric phases between ~49 at. % Se and ~53 at. % Fe, and temperatures up to ~450 °C. The low temperature stable phases are the tetragonal PbO-structure (P4/nmm) β-Fe1−xSe and α-Fe7Se8. The high temperature phase is the hexagonal, NiAs structure (P63/mmc) δ-Fe1−xSe. Iron (II) selenide occurs naturally as the NiAs-structure mineral achavalite.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Iron(II)_selenide","IUPAC name":"Iron(II) selenide","CAS Number":"1310-32-3","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.798","EC Number":"215-177-1","PubChem CID":"14795","Chemical formula":"FeSe","Molar mass":"134.81 g/mol","Appearance":"black crystals","Density":"4.72 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"965 °C (1,769 °F; 1,238 K)","Solubility in water":"0.975 g/100 mL","Crystal structure":"hexagonal / tetragonal"}
