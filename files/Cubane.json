{"name":"Cubane","desc":"Cubane (C8H8) is a synthetic hydrocarbon molecule that consists of eight carbon atoms arranged at the corners of a cube, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. A solid crystalline substance, cubane is one of the Platonic hydrocarbons and a member of the prismanes. It was first synthesized in 1964 by Philip Eaton and Thomas Cole. Before this work, researchers believed that cubic carbon-based molecules would be too unstable to exist. The cubic shape requires the carbon atoms to adopt an unusually sharp 90° bonding angle, which would be highly strained as compared to the 109.45° angle of a tetrahedral carbon. Once formed, cubane is quite kinetically stable, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths. It is the simplest hydrocarbon with octahedral symmetry.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of cubane","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Cuban.svg/100px-Cuban.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cubane","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Cubane[1]\nCubane[1]","Systematic IUPAC name":"Pentacyclo[4.2.0.02,5.03,8.04,7]octane\nPentacyclo[4.2.0.02,5.03,8.04,7]octane","CAS Number":"277-10-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33014 Y","ChemSpider":"119867 Y","PubChem CID":"136090","Chemical formula":"C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>","Molar mass":"104.15 g/mol","Density":"1.29 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"133.5 °C (272.3 °F; 406.6 K)[2]","Boiling point":"161.6 °C (322.9 °F; 434.8 K)[2]","Related hydrocarbons":"Cuneane\nDodecahedrane\nTetrahedrane\nPrismane\nPrismane C8","Related compounds":"Heptanitrocubane\nOctanitrocubane\nOctaazacubane","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
