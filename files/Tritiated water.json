{"name":"Tritiated water","desc":"Tritiated water is a radioactive form of water where the usual hydrogen atoms are replaced with tritium. In its pure form it may be called tritium oxide (T2O or 3H2O) or super-heavy water. Pure T2O is corrosive due to self-radiolysis. Diluted, tritiated water is mainly H2O plus some HTO (3HOH). It is also used as a tracer for water transport studies in life-science research. Furthermore, since it naturally occurs in minute quantities, it can be used to determine the age of various water-based liquids, such as vintage wines.","images":[{"alt":"All types of isotopically substituted water molecules have this structure.","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Tritium-oxide-2D.png/120px-Tritium-oxide-2D.png"},{"alt":"Water molecule 3D.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Water_molecule_3D.svg/200px-Water_molecule_3D.svg.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tritium_oxide","IUPAC name":"[3H]2-water","Systematic IUPAC name":"(3H2)Water\n(3H2)Water","Other names":"Super-heavy water\nTritium oxide\nDitritium oxide\n\n\n\n\nSuper-heavy water\nTritium oxide\nDitritium oxide","CAS Number":"14940-65-9 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29374 N","ChemSpider":"94563 N","MeSH":"tritium+oxide","PubChem CID":"104752","Chemical formula":"T<sub>2</sub>O or <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O","Molar mass":"22.0315 g mol−1","Density":"1.215g/cc","Melting point":"4.49[1][2][3] °C (40.08 °F; 277.64 K)","Main hazards":"Corrosive (C)\nRadioactive","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
