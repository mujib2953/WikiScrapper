{"name":"Diethylamine","desc":"Diethylamine is an organic compound with the formula (CH3CH2)2NH. It is a secondary amine. It is a flammable, weakly alkaline liquid that is miscible with most solvents. It is a colorless liquid, but commercial samples often appear brown due to impurities. It has a strong ammonia-like odor.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of diethylamine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/DiethylamineSVG.svg/130px-DiethylamineSVG.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of the diethylamine molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Diethylamine_3D_ball.png/160px-Diethylamine_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Diethylamine","Preferred IUPAC name":"N-Ethylethanamine\nN-Ethylethanamine","[2]":"(Diethyl)amine\nDiethylamine (deprecated[2])","CAS Number":"109-89-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"605268","ChEBI":"CHEBI:85259 N","ChemSpider":"7730 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.380","EC Number":"203-716-3","MeSH":"diethylamine","PubChem CID":"8021","RTECS number":"HZ8750000","UNII":"B035PIS86W Y","UN number":"1154","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>11</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span>","Molar mass":"73.14 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colourless liquid","Odor":"fishy, ammoniacal","Density":"0.7074 g mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>","Melting point":"−49.80 °C; −57.64 °F; 223.35 K","Boiling point":"54.8 to 56.4 °C; 130.5 to 133.4 °F; 327.9 to 329.5 K","Solubility in water":"Miscible","log P":"0.657","Vapor pressure":"24.2–97.5 kPa","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"150 μmol Pa−1 kg−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-56.8·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.385","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"178.1 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−131 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−3.035 MJ mol−1","Safety data sheet":"hazard.com","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H302, H312, H314, H332","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P280, P305+351+338, P310","NFPA 704":"3\n3\n1","Flash point":"−23 °C (−9 °F; 250 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"312 °C (594 °F; 585 K)","Explosive limits":"1.8–10.1%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"540 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n500 mg/kg (mouse, oral)[4]","LC50 (median concentration)":"4000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 25 ppm (75 mg/m3)[3]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 ppm (30 mg/m3) ST 25 ppm (75 mg/m3)[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"200 ppm[3]","Related amines":"Ethylamine\nDimethylamine\nTrimethylamine\nTriethylamine\nDiisopropylamine","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
