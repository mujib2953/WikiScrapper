{"name":"Chromic acid","desc":"The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, H2CrO4 of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formulae of dichromic acid (left) and chromic acid (right)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/ChromicAcid.png/260px-ChromicAcid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromic_acid","IUPAC name":"Chromic acid","Systematic IUPAC name":"Dihydroxidodioxidochromium\nDihydroxidodioxidochromium","Other names":"Chromic(VI) acid\nTetraoxochromic acid","CAS Number":"7738-94-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33143 Y","ChemSpider":"22834 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.910","EC Number":"231-801-5","Gmelin Reference":"25982","PubChem CID":"24425","UNII":"SA8VOV0V7Q Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Chromium\">Cr</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"118.01 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Dark red crystals","Density":"1.201 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"197 °C (387 °F; 470 K)","Boiling point":"250 °C (482 °F; 523 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"169 g/100 mL","Acidity (pKa)":"-0.8 to 1.6","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"51.9 mg/kg (H2CrO4·2Na, rat, oral)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.005 mg/m3[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.001 mg Cr(VI)/m3[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"15 mg Cr(VI)/m3[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
