{"name":"Nickel(II) hydroxide","desc":"Nickel(II) hydroxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Ni(OH)2. It is an apple-green solid that dissolves with decomposition in ammonia and amines and is attacked by acids. It is electroactive, being converted to the Ni(III) oxy-hydroxide, leading to widespread applications in rechargeable battery.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel(II) hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Hydroxid_nikelnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Hydroxid_nikelnat%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"Nickel(II) hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Kristallstruktur_Cadmiumiodid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Cadmiumiodid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel(II)_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Nickel(II) hydroxide","Other names":"Nickel hydroxide, Theophrastite","CAS Number":"12054-48-7 Y\n36897-37-7 (monohydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"55452 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.813","EC Number":"235-008-5","PubChem CID":"61534","RTECS number":"QR648000","Chemical formula":"Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"92.724 g/mol (anhydrous)\n110.72 g/mol (monohydrate)","Appearance":"green crystals","Density":"4.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"230 °C (446 °F; 503 K) (anhydrous, decomposes)","Solubility in water":"0.13 g/L","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+4500.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"hexagonal, hP3","Space group":"P3m1, No. 164","Lattice constant":"a = 0.3117 nm, b = 0.3117 nm, c = 0.4595 nm\nα = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 120°","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"79 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−538 kJ·mol−1[2]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1515 mg/kg (oral, rat)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
