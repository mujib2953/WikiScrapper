{"name":"Cadmium telluride","desc":"Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a stable crystalline compound formed from cadmium and tellurium. It is mainly used as the semiconducting material in cadmium telluride photovoltaics and an infrared optical window. It is usually sandwiched with cadmium sulfide to form a p-n junction solar PV cell. Typically, CdTe PV cells use a n-i-p structure.","images":[{"alt":"Sphalerite-unit-cell-depth-fade-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Sphalerite-unit-cell-depth-fade-3D-balls.png/200px-Sphalerite-unit-cell-depth-fade-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Cadmium telluride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/CdTe.jpg/200px-CdTe.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_telluride","Other names":"Irtran-6","CAS Number":"1306-25-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"82622 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.773","PubChem CID":"91501","RTECS number":"EV3330000","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Cadmium\">Cd</span><span title=\"Tellurium\">Te</span>","Molar mass":"240.01 g/mol","Density":"5.85 g&#xB7;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Capper1994_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Capper1994-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"1,041 °C (1,906 °F; 1,314 K)[2]","Boiling point":"1,050 °C (1,920 °F; 1,320 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility in other solvents":"insoluble","Band gap":"1.5 eV (@300 K, direct)","Refractive index (nD)":"2.67 (@10 µm)","Crystal structure":"Zinc blende","Space group":"F43m","Lattice constant":"a = 648 pm","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/21/22, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S60, S61","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"[1910.1027] TWA 0.005 mg/m3 (as Cd)[3]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [9 mg/m3 (as Cd)][3]","Other anions":"Cadmium oxide\nCadmium sulfide\nCadmium selenide","Other cations":"Zinc telluride\nMercury telluride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
