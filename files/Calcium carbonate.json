{"name":"Calcium carbonate","desc":"Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3. It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create limescale. It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium carbonate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Calcium_carbonate.png/100px-Calcium_carbonate.png"},{"alt":"Calcium carbonate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Calcium_carbonate.jpg/200px-Calcium_carbonate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_carbonate","":"","IUPAC name":"Calcium carbonate","Limestonecalcitearagonitechalkmarblepearloyster":"Limestone; calcite; aragonite; chalk; marble; pearl; oyster","CAS Number":"471-34-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:3311 Y","ChemSpider":"9708 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.119.341","EC Number":"207-439-9","E number":"E170 (colours)","KEGG":"D00932 Y","PubChem CID":"10112","RTECS number":"FF9335000","UNII":"H0G9379FGK Y","Chemical formula":"CaCO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"100.0869 g/mol","Appearance":"Fine white powder; chalky taste","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.711 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (<a href=\"/wiki/Calcite\" title=\"Calcite\">calcite</a>)<br>\n2.83 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (<a href=\"/wiki/Aragonite\" title=\"Aragonite\">aragonite</a>)","Melting point":"1,339 °C (2,442 °F; 1,612 K) (calcite)\n825 °C (1517 °F; 1,098 K) (aragonite) [1]","Boiling point":"decomposes","Solubility in water":"0.013 g/L (25 °C)[2][3]","Solubility product (Ksp)":"3.3×10−9[4]","Solubility in dilute acids":"soluble","Acidity (pKa)":"9.0","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-38.2·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.59","Crystal structure":"Trigonal","Space group":"32/m","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"93 J·mol−1·K−1[5]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1207 kJ·mol−1[5]","ATC code":"A02AC01 (WHO) A12AA04 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1193","NFPA 704":"0\n0\n0","Flash point":"825 °C (1,517 °F; 1,098 K)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"6450 mg/kg (oral, rat)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp)[6]","Other anions":"Calcium bicarbonate","Other cations":"Magnesium carbonate\nStrontium carbonate\nBarium carbonate","Related compounds":"Calcium sulfate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
