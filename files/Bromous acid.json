{"name":"Bromous acid","desc":"Bromous acid is the inorganic compound with the formula of HBrO2. It is an unstable compound, although salts of its conjugate base - bromites - have been isolated. In acidic solution, bromites decompose to bromine.","images":[{"alt":"Bromige saeure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Bromige_saeure.png/200px-Bromige_saeure.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the bromous acid molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Bromous_acid_molecule_spacefill.png/160px-Bromous_acid_molecule_spacefill.png"},{"alt":"Bromous acid molecule ball.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Bromous_acid_molecule_ball.png/160px-Bromous_acid_molecule_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Bromous_acid","IUPAC names":"hydroxy-λ3-bromanone\nhydroxidooxidobromine\nbromous acid","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29247 Y","ChemSpider":"145144 Y","PubChem CID":"165616","Chemical formula":"HBrO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"112.911 g/mol","Other anions":"Hydrobromic acid; hypobromous acid; bromic acid; perbromic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
