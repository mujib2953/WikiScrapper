{"name":"4-Aminopyridine","desc":"4-Aminopyridine (4-AP, INN fampridine, USAN dalfampridine) is an organic compound with the chemical formula C5H4N–NH2. The molecule is one of the three isomeric amines of pyridine. It is used as a research tool in characterizing subtypes of the potassium channel. It has also been used as a drug, to manage some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and is indicated for symptomatic improvement of walking in adults with several variations of the disease. It was undergoing Phase III clinical trials as of 2008[update], and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the compound on January 22, 2010. Fampridine is also marketed as Ampyra (pronounced \"am-PEER-ah,\" according to the maker's website) in the United States by Acorda Therapeutics and as Fampyra in Europe. In Canada, the medication has been approved for use by Health Canada since February 10, 2012.","images":[{"alt":"4-aminopyridine.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/4-aminopyridine.svg/80px-4-aminopyridine.svg.png"},{"alt":"4-aminopyridine sample.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/4-aminopyridine_sample.jpg/220px-4-aminopyridine_sample.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/4-aminopyridine","Preferred IUPAC name":"Pyridin-4-amine\nPyridin-4-amine","Other names":"4-Pyridinamine\n4-Pyridylamine\nFampridine","CAS Number":"504-24-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:34385 Y","ChemSpider":"1664 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.262","IUPHAR/BPS":"2416","KEGG":"D04127 Y","MeSH":"4-Aminopyridine","PubChem CID":"1727","UNII":"BH3B64OKL9 Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"94.1146 g/mol","Appearance":"colourless solid","Melting point":"155 to 158 °C (311 to 316 °F; 428 to 431 K)","Boiling point":"273 °C (523 °F; 546 K)","Solubility in water":"polar organic solvents","ATC code":"N07XX07 (WHO)","Pregnancy\ncategory":"US: C (Risk not ruled out)","Routes of\nadministration":"Oral","Pharmacokinetics":"","Bioavailability":"96%","Legal status":"US: ℞-only","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
