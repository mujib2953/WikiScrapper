{"name":"Indium antimonide","desc":"Indium antimonide (InSb) is a crystalline compound made from the elements indium (In) and antimony (Sb). It is a narrow-gap semiconductor material from the III-V group used in infrared detectors, including thermal imaging cameras, FLIR systems, infrared homing missile guidance systems, and in infrared astronomy. The indium antimonide detectors are sensitive between 1–5 µm wavelengths. Indium antimonide was a very common detector in the old, single-detector mechanically scanned thermal imaging systems. Another application is as a terahertz radiation source as it is a strong photo-Dember emitter.","images":[{"alt":"Ball and stick cell model of indium antimonide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Sphalerite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/244px-Sphalerite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Sample of crystalline indium antimonide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Indium_antimonide.jpg/244px-Indium_antimonide.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Indium(III)_antimonide","CAS Number":"1312-41-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"2709929 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.812","EC Number":"215-192-3","PubChem CID":"3468413","RTECS number":"NL1105000","UN number":"1549","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Indium\">In</span><span title=\"Antimony\">Sb</span>","Molar mass":"236.58 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Dark grey, metallic crystals","Density":"5.775 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"527 °C (981 °F; 800 K)","Band gap":"0.17 eV","Electron mobility":"7.7 mC s g−1 (at 27 °C)","Thermal conductivity":"180 mW K−1 cm−1 (at 27 °C)","Refractive index (nD)":"4.0","Crystal structure":"Zincblende","Space group":"T2d-F-43m","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"WARNING","GHS hazard statements":"H302, H332, H411","GHS precautionary statements":"P273","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
