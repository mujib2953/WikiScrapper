{"name":"Aluminium sulfide","desc":"Aluminum sulfide or aluminium sulphide is a chemical compound with the formula Al2S3. This colorless species has an interesting structural chemistry, existing in several forms. The material is sensitive to moisture, hydrolyzing to hydrated aluminium oxides/hydroxides. This can begin when the sulfide is exposed to the atmosphere. The hydrolysis reaction generates gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S).","images":[{"alt":"Sulfid hlinitý.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Sulfid_hlinit%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Sulfid_hlinit%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_sulfide","Other names":"Aluminum sulfide","CAS Number":"1302-81-4 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"140154 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.736","PubChem CID":"16684788","Chemical formula":"Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"150.158 g/mol","Appearance":"gray solid","Density":"2.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,100 °C (2,010 °F; 1,370 K)","Boiling point":"1,500 °C (2,730 °F; 1,770 K) sublimes","Solubility in water":"decomposes","Solubility":"insoluble in acetone","Crystal structure":"trigonal","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"105.1 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"116.9 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-724 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"[1]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n2","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
