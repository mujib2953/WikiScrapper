{"name":"Nickel sulfide","desc":"Nickel sulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula NiS. It is a black solid that is produced by treating nickel(II) salts with hydrogen sulfide. Many nickel sulfides are known, including the mineral millerite, which also has the formula NiS. Aside from being useful ores, nickel sulfides are the products of desulfurization reactions, and are sometimes used as catalysts. Nonstoichiometric forms of nickel sulfide are known, e.g., Ni9S8 and Ni3S2.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel-arsenide-3D-unit-cell.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Nickel-arsenide-3D-unit-cell.png/200px-Nickel-arsenide-3D-unit-cell.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel_sulfide","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Nickel sulfide [1]\nNickel sulfide [1]","Other names":"nickel monosulfide, nickelous sulfide","CAS Number":"16812-54-7","ChemSpider":"26134","ECHA InfoCard":"100.037.113","EC Number":"234-349-7","PubChem CID":"28094","RTECS number":"QR9705000","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">NiS</span>","Molar mass":"90.7584 g mol−1","Appearance":"black solid","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"5.87 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"797 °C (1,467 °F; 1,070 K)","Boiling point":"1,388 °C (2,530 °F; 1,661 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"soluble in nitric acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+190.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"hexagonal","Main hazards":"may cause cancer by inhalation","GHS pictograms":"","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
