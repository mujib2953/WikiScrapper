{"name":"Thionyl fluoride","desc":"Thionyl fluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula SOF2. This colourless gas is mainly of theoretical interest, but it is a product of the degradation of sulfur hexafluoride, an insulator in electrical equipment. The molecule adopts a distorted pyramidal structure, with Cs symmetry. The S-O and S-F distances are 1.42 and 1.58 Å, respectively. The O-S-F and F-S-F angles are 106.2 and 92.2°, respectively. Thionyl chloride and thionyl bromide have similar structures, although these compounds are liquid at room temperature. Mixed halides are also known, such as SOClF, thionyl chloride fluoride.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/SOF2.png/150px-SOF2.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Thionyl_difluoride","":"","IUPAC name":"Thionyl fluoride","CAS Number":"7783-42-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22954 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.088","PubChem CID":"24548","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Fluorine\">F</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"86.06 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless gas","Melting point":"−110.5 °C (−166.9 °F; 162.7 K)","Boiling point":"−43.8 °C (−46.8 °F; 229.3 K)","Solubility in water":"hydrolysis","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, ether, benzene","Vapor pressure":"75.7 kPa (-50 °C)[1]","Molecular shape":"trigonal pyramidal","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"278.6 J/mol·K[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-715 kJ/mol[2]","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"56.8 J/mol·K[2]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"T  C","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36/37/38[3]","S-phrases (outdated)":"S36/37, S38, S45, S63","Related oxohalides":"Thionyl chloride\nThionyl bromide","Related compounds":"Nitrosyl fluoride\nCarbonyl fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
