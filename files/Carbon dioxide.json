{"name":"Carbon dioxide","desc":"Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is a colorless gas with a density about 60% higher than that of air (1.225 g/L) that is odorless at normally encountered concentrations. Carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, ice caps, glaciers and seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of carbon dioxide with bond length","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Carbon-dioxide-2D-dimensions.svg/170px-Carbon-dioxide-2D-dimensions.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of carbon dioxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Carbon_dioxide_3D_ball.png/100px-Carbon_dioxide_3D_ball.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/12px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Carbon_dioxide","":"","Dry ice":"Carbonic acid gas\nCarbonic anhydride\nCarbonic oxide\nCarbon oxide\nCarbon(IV) oxide\nDry ice (solid phase)","CAS Number":"124-38-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","3DMet":"B01131","Beilstein Reference":"1900390","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16526 Y","ChemSpider":"274 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.004.271","EC Number":"204-696-9","E number":"E290 (preservatives)","Gmelin Reference":"989","KEGG":"D00004 Y","MeSH":"Carbon+dioxide","RTECS number":"FF6400000","UNII":"142M471B3J Y","UN number":"1013 (gas), 1845 (solid)","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"44.01 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless gas","Odor":"Low concentrations: none\nHigh concentrations:\nsharp; acidic[1]","Density":"1562 kg/m<sup>3</sup> <small>(solid at 1&#xA0;atm and &#x2212;78.5&#xA0;&#xB0;C)</small><br>\n1101 kg/m<sup>3</sup> <small>(liquid at saturation &#x2212;37&#xB0;C)</small><br>\n1.977&#xA0;kg/m<sup>3</sup> <small>(gas at 1&#xA0;atm and 0&#xA0;&#xB0;C)</small>","Melting point":"−56.6 °C; −69.8 °F; 216.6 K (Triple point at 5.1 atm)","Sublimation\nconditions":"−78.5 °C; −109.2 °F; 194.7 K (1 atm)","Solubility in water":"1.45 g/L at 25 °C (77 °F), 100 kPa","Vapor pressure":"5.73 MPa (20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"6.35, 10.33","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−20.5·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.00045","Viscosity":"0.07 cP at −78.5 °C","Dipole moment":"0 D","Crystal structure":"trigonal","Molecular shape":"linear","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"37.135 J/K mol","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"214 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−393.5 kJ·mol−1","ATC code":"V03AN02 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nSigma-Aldrich","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LCLo (lowest published)":"90,000 ppm (human, 5 min)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5000 ppm (9000 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 5000 ppm (9000 mg/m3) ST 30,000 ppm (54,000 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"40,000 ppm[2]","Other anions":"Carbon disulfide\nCarbon diselenide\nCarbon ditelluride","Other cations":"Silicon dioxide\nGermanium dioxide\nTin dioxide\nLead dioxide","Related carbon oxides":"Carbon monoxide\nCarbon suboxide\nDicarbon monoxide\nCarbon trioxide","Related compounds":"Carbonic acid\nCarbonyl sulfide","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).","Infobox references":""}
