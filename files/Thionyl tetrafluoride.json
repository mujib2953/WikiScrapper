{"name":"Thionyl tetrafluoride","desc":"Thionyl tetrafluoride is an inorganic compound gas with the formula SOF4. It is also known as sulfur tetrafluoride oxide. The shape of the molecule is a distorted trigonal bipyramid. The oxygen is found on the equator. The atoms on the equator have shorter bond lengths than the fluorine atoms on the axis. The sulfur oxygen bond is 1.409Å. A S-F bond on the axis has length 1.596Å and the S-F bond on the equator has length 1.539Å. The angle between the equatorial fluorine atoms is 112.8°. The angle between axial fluorine and oxygen is 97.7°. The angle between oxygen and equatorial fluorine is 123.6° and between axial and equatorial fluorine is 85.7°. The fluorine atoms only produce one NMR line, probably because they exchange positions.","images":[{"alt":"Structure of thionyl tetrafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Sulfur_oxytetrafluoride.png/200px-Sulfur_oxytetrafluoride.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of thionyl tetrafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Thionyl-tetrafluoride-3D-balls.png/100px-Thionyl-tetrafluoride-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sulfur_tetrafluoride_oxide","":"","IUPAC name":"Thionyl tetrafluoride","CAS Number":"13709-54-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"123077 N","PubChem CID":"139557","Chemical formula":"SOF<sub>4</sub>","Appearance":"colorless gas","Density":"1.653-0.0036T (&#xB0;C) liquid<sup id=\"cite_ref-aiic_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-aiic-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−99.6 °C (−147.3 °F; 173.6 K)","Boiling point":"−49 °C (−56 °F; 224 K) 5090 cal/mol heat of vapourisation[1]","Solubility in water":"reaction in water","log P":"7.2349-859.58/T-26275/T²[1]","Molecular shape":"distorted trigonal bipyramid","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36/37/38[2]","Related oxohalides":"Thionyl fluoride\nSelenyl tetrafluoride","Related compounds":"Phosphoryl trifluoride\npentafluorosulfur hypofluorite\nsulfuryl fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
