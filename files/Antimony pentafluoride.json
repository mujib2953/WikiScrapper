{"name":"Antimony pentafluoride","desc":"Antimony pentafluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula SbF5. This colourless, viscous liquid is a valuable Lewis acid and a component of the superacid fluoroantimonic acid, the strongest known acid. It is notable for its Lewis acidity and its ability to react with almost all known compounds.","images":[{"alt":"Antimony pentafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Antimony-pentafluoride-2D.png/100px-Antimony-pentafluoride-2D.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Antimony_pentafluoride","":"","IUPAC name":"antimony(V) fluoride","Other names":"antimony pentafluoride\npentafluoridoantimony","CAS Number":"7783-70-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22963 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.110","PubChem CID":"24557","RTECS number":"CC5800000","UN number":"1732","Chemical formula":"SbF<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"216.74 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless oily liquid\nhygroscopic","Odor":"pungent","Density":"2.99 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"8.3 °C (46.9 °F; 281.4 K)","Boiling point":"149.5 °C (301.1 °F; 422.6 K)","Solubility in water":"Reacts","Solubility":"soluble in KF, liquid SO2","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0220","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/22, R51/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S61","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n1\nW","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[2]","Other anions":"Antimony pentachloride","Other cations":"Phosphorus pentafluoride\nArsenic pentafluoride\nBismuth pentafluoride","Related compounds":"Antimony trifluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
