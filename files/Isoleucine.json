{"name":"Isoleucine","desc":"Isoleucine (abbreviated as Ile or I) encoded by the codons ATT, ATC, ATA is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+\n3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain, classifying it as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and must be ingested in our diet. Isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes in other organisms such as bacteria.","images":[{"alt":"Chemical structure of Isoleucine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/L-Isoleucin_-_L-Isoleucine.svg/100px-L-Isoleucin_-_L-Isoleucine.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Isoleucine","":"","IUPAC name":"Isoleucine","Other names":"2-Amino-3-methylpentanoic acid","CAS Number":"73-32-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:58045 Y","ChemSpider":"6067 Y","DrugBank":"DB00167 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.726","IUPHAR/BPS":"3311","KEGG":"D00065 Y","PubChem CID":"791","UNII":"04Y7590D77 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>13</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"131.18 g·mol−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-84.9·10−6 cm3/mol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
