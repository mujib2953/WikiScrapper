{"name":"Thallium(I) chloride","desc":"Thallium(I) chloride, also known as thallous chloride, is a chemical compound with the formula TlCl. This colourless solid is an intermediate in the isolation of thallium from its ores. Typically, an acidic solution of thallium(I) sulfate is treated with hydrochloric acid to precipitate insoluble thallium(I) chloride. This solid crystallizes in the caesium chloride motif.","images":[{"alt":"Thallium(I)-chloride-3D-SF-C.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Thallium%28I%29-chloride-3D-SF-C.png/100px-Thallium%28I%29-chloride-3D-SF-C.png"},{"alt":"Thallium(I) chloride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Thallium%28I%29_chloride.jpg/240px-Thallium%28I%29_chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Thallium(I)_chloride","":"","IUPAC names":"Thallium monochloride\nThallium(I) chloride","Other names":"Thallous chloride","CAS Number":"7791-12-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:37117 Y","ChemSpider":"23044 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.311","PubChem CID":"24642","Chemical formula":"TlCl","Molar mass":"239.836 g/mol[1]","Appearance":"white, odorless crystalline solid[1]","Density":"7.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-r1_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-r1-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"431 °C (808 °F; 704 K)[1]","Boiling point":"720 °C (1,328 °F; 993 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"3.3 g/L (25 °C)[1]","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohol[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−57.8·10−6 cm3/mol[2]","Refractive index (nD)":"2.247 (0.59 µm)\n2.198 (0.75 µm)\n2.145 (1 µm)\n1.891 (5 µm)\n2.193 (20 µm)[3]","Crystal structure":"CsCl, cP2","Space group":"Pm3m, No. 221[4]","Lattice constant":"a = 0.38416 nm","Lattice volume (V)":"0.0567 nm3","Formula units (Z)":"1","Coordination geometry":"Cubic (Tl+)\nCubic (Cl−)","Safety data sheet":"http://www.crystran.co.uk/uploads/files/178.pdf","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Very toxic (T+)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R26/28, R33, R51/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S13, S28, S45, S61","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"24 mg/kg, oral, mouse","Other anions":"Thallium(I) fluoride\nThallium(I) bromide\nThallium(I) iodide","Other cations":"Thallium(III) chloride\nSilver(I) chloride\nLead(II) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
