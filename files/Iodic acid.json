{"name":"Iodic acid","desc":"Iodic acid, HIO3, can be obtained as a white or off-white solid. It dissolves in water very well, but it also exists in the pure state, as opposed to chloric acid or bromic acid. Iodic acid contains iodine in the oxidation state +5 and it is one of the most stable oxo-acids of the halogens in its pure state. When iodic acid is carefully heated, it dehydrates to iodine pentoxide. On subsequent heating, the iodine pentoxide further decomposes, giving a mix of iodine, oxygen and lower oxides of iodine.","images":[{"alt":"Iodic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Iodic-acid-2D.png/200px-Iodic-acid-2D.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of iodic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Iodic-acid-3D-balls.png/100px-Iodic-acid-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iodic_acid","":"","Other names":"Iodic(V) acid","CAS Number":"7782-68-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:24857 Y","ChemSpider":"22761 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.056","PubChem CID":"24345","Chemical formula":"HIO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"175.91 g/mol","Appearance":"White solid","Density":"4.62 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"110 °C (230 °F; 383 K)","Solubility in water":"269 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"0.75","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−48.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other cations":"Lithium iodate\nPotassium iodate","Related halogen oxoacids":"Chloric acid\nBromic acid","Related compounds":"Hydroiodic acid\nIodine pentoxide\nPeriodic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
