{"name":"Formamide","desc":"Formamide, also known as methanamide, is an amide derived from formic acid. It is a clear liquid which is miscible with water and has an ammonia-like odor. It is chemical feedstock for the manufacture of sulfa drugs, other pharmaceuticals, herbicides, pesticides and the manufacture of hydrocyanic acid. It has been used as a softener for paper and fiber. It is a solvent for many ionic compounds. It has also been used as a solvent for resins and plasticizers.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of the formamide molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Formamide-2D.png/200px-Formamide-2D.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of formamide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Formamide-3D-balls.png/100px-Formamide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Formamide","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Formamide[1]\nFormamide[1]","Systematic IUPAC name":"Methanamide\nMethanamide","Other names":"Carbamaldehyde","CAS Number":"75-12-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:48431 Y","ChemSpider":"693 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.766","IUPHAR/BPS":"4739","KEGG":"C00488 Y","PubChem CID":"713","Chemical formula":"CH<sub>3</sub>NO","Molar mass":"45.04 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless, oily liquid[2]","Density":"1.133 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2 to 3 °C (36 to 37 °F; 275 to 276 K)","Boiling point":"210 °C (410 °F; 483 K)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Vapor pressure":"0.08 mmHg at 20 °C","Acidity (pKa)":"23.5 (in DMSO)[3]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-21.9·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n0","Flash point":"154 °C (309 °F; 427 K) (closed cup)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 ppm (15 mg/m3) [skin][2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[2]","Related compounds":"Carbamic acid\nDimethylformamide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
