{"name":"Alanine","desc":"Alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A; encoded by the codons GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain methyl group, classifying it as a nonpolar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it.","images":[{"alt":"Alanine at physiological pH","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Alanine_at_physiological_pH.png/140px-Alanine_at_physiological_pH.png"},{"alt":"Alanine in non-ionic form","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/L-Alanin_-_L-Alanine.svg/170px-L-Alanin_-_L-Alanine.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Alanine","IUPAC name":"Alanine","Other names":"2-Aminopropanoic acid","CAS Number":"338-69-2 (D-isomer) Y\n56-41-7 (L-isomer) Y\n302-72-7 (racemic) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16977 N","ChemSpider":"64234 (D-isomer) Y\n5735 (L-isomer) Y\n582 (Racemic) Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.249","EC Number":"206-126-4","IUPHAR/BPS":"720","KEGG":"C01401 N","PubChem CID":"5950","UNII":"1FU7983T0U N","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"89.09 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white powder","Density":"1.424 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"258 °C (496 °F; 531 K) (sublimes)","Solubility in water":"167.2 g/L (25 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"2.35 (carboxyl), 9.69 (amino)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-50.5·10−6 cm3/mol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
