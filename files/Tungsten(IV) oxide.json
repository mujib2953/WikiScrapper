{"name":"Tungsten(IV) oxide","desc":"Tungsten dioxide is the chemical compound with the formula WO2. The bronze-colored solid crystallizes in a monoclinic cell. The rutile-like structure features distorted octahedral WO6 centers with alternate short W–W bonds (248 pm). Each tungsten center has the d2 configuration, which gives the material a high electrical conductivity.","images":[{"alt":"Tungsten(IV) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/WO2structure.jpg/200px-WO2structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Tungsten(IV)_oxide","Other names":"Tungsten dioxide","CAS Number":"12036-22-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.662","EC Number":"234-842-7","PubChem CID":"82850","Chemical formula":"WO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"215.839 g/mol","Appearance":"bronze solid","Density":"10.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,700 °C (3,090 °F; 1,970 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"negligible","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"5.7×10−5 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Distorted rutile, (monoclinic), mP12, Space group P21/c, No 14","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Tungsten disulfide","Other cations":"Chromium(IV) oxide\nMolybdenum(IV) oxide","Related tungsten oxides":"Tungsten(III) oxide\nTungsten(VI) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
