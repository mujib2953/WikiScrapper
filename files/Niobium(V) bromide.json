{"name":"Niobium(V) bromide","desc":"Niobium(V) bromide is the inorganic compound with the formula Nb2Br10. Its name comes from the compound's empirical formula, NbBr5. It is a diamagnetic, orange solid that hydrolyses readily. The compound adopts an edge-shared bioctahedral structure, which means that two NbBr5 units are joined by a pair of bromide bridges. The pentachloride and pentaiodides of Nb and Ta share this structural motif. There is no bond between the Nb centres. It is prepared by the reaction of bromine with niobium metal at high temperature in a tube furnace.","images":[{"alt":"Nb2Br10'.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Nb2Br10%27.png/200px-Nb2Br10%27.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Niobium(V)_bromide","Other names":"niobium pentabromide","CAS Number":"13748-45-0 NbBr5 N\n17633-68-0 Nb2Br10 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"19388901 Y","EC Number":"236-778-5","PubChem CID":"83517","Chemical formula":"NbBr<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"492.430 g/mol","Appearance":"wine red to black crystals","Density":"4.417 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"254 °C (489 °F; 527 K)","Boiling point":"364 °C (687 °F; 637 K)","Solubility in water":"soluble","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
