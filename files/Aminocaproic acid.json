{"name":"Aminocaproic acid","desc":"Aminocaproic acid (also known as ε-aminocaproic acid, ε-Ahx, or 6-aminohexanoic acid) is a derivative and analogue of the amino acid lysine, which makes it an effective inhibitor for enzymes that bind that particular residue. Such enzymes include proteolytic enzymes like plasmin, the enzyme responsible for fibrinolysis. For this reason it is effective in treatment of certain bleeding disorders, and it is marketed as Amicar. Aminocaproic acid is also an intermediate in the polymerization of Nylon-6, where it is formed by ring-opening hydrolysis of caprolactam.","images":[{"alt":"6-Aminocaproic acid.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/6-Aminocaproic_acid.png/220px-6-Aminocaproic_acid.png"},{"alt":"Aminocaproic acid ball-and-stick.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Aminocaproic_acid_ball-and-stick.png/220px-Aminocaproic_acid_ball-and-stick.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aminocaproic_acid"}
