{"name":"Ammonium carbonate","desc":"Ammonium carbonate is a salt with the chemical formula (NH4)2CO3. Since it readily degrades to gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide upon heating, it is used as a leavening agent and also as smelling salt. It is also known as baker's ammonia and was a predecessor to the more modern leavening agents baking soda and baking powder. It is a component of what was formerly known as sal volatile and salt of hartshorn.","images":[{"alt":"Ammonium carbonate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ammonium_carbonate.png/200px-Ammonium_carbonate.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of two ammonium cations and one carbonate anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Ammonium-carbonate-3D-balls.png/220px-Ammonium-carbonate-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Uhličitan amonný.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Uhli%C4%8Ditan_amonn%C3%BD.JPG/244px-Uhli%C4%8Ditan_amonn%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_carbonate","IUPAC name":"Ammonium carbonate","Other names":"baker's ammonia\nsal volatile\nsalt of hartshorn\nE503\n\n\n\n\nbaker's ammonia\nsal volatile\nsalt of hartshorn\nE503","CAS Number":"506-87-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"10048 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.326","E number":"E503 (acidity regulators, ...)","IUPHAR/BPS":"4509","UNII":"PDP691CN28 Y","Chemical formula":"(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"96.09 g/mol","Appearance":"White powder","Density":"1.50 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"58 °C (136 °F; 331 K)","Boiling point":"Decomposes","Solubility in water":"100g/100ml(20°C),decomposes in hot water","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-42.50·10−6 cm3/mol","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","Other anions":"Ammonium bicarbonate","Other cations":"Sodium carbonate\nPotassium carbonate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
