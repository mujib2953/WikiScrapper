{"name":"Polonium hydride","desc":"Polonium hydride (also known as polonium dihydride, hydrogen polonide, or polane) is a chemical compound with the formula PoH2. It is a liquid at room temperature, the second hydrogen chalcogenide with this property after water. It is very unstable chemically and tends to decompose into elemental polonium and hydrogen; like all polonium compounds, it is highly radioactive. It is a volatile and very labile compound, from which many polonides can be derived.","images":[{"alt":"Space-filling model of the hydrogen polonide molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Polonium-hydride-3D-vdW.svg/115px-Polonium-hydride-3D-vdW.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Polonium_hydride","Preferred IUPAC name":"Polonium hydride\nPolonium hydride","Systematic IUPAC name":"Polane\nPolane","CAS Number":"31060-73-8","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30444","ChemSpider":"22383","Gmelin Reference":"25163, 169602","PubChem CID":"23941","Chemical formula":"PoH<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"210.998 g/mol","Melting point":"−35.3 °C (−31.5 °F; 237.8 K)[1]","Boiling point":"36.1 °C (97.0 °F; 309.2 K)[1]","Other anions":"H2O\nH2S\nH2Se\nH2Te","Other cations":"TlH3\nPbH4\nBiH3\nHAt"}
