{"name":"Cyanogen","desc":"Cyanogen is the chemical compound with the formula (CN)2. It is a colorless, toxic gas with a pungent odor. The molecule is a pseudohalogen. Cyanogen molecules consist of two CN groups – analogous to diatomic halogen molecules, such as Cl2, but far less oxidizing. The two cyano groups are bonded together at their carbon atoms: N≡C−C≡N, although other isomers have been detected. Certain derivatives of cyanogen are also called \"cyanogen\" even though they contain only one CN group. For example, cyanogen bromide has the formula NCBr.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of cyanogen","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Cyanogen.png/100px-Cyanogen.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of cyanogen","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Cyanogen-3D-balls.png/100px-Cyanogen-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cyanogen","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Oxalonitrile[1]\nOxalonitrile[1]","[1][2][3][4][3][4]":"Ethanedinitrile[1]\nCyanogen\nBis(nitridocarbon)(C—C)[2]\nDicyan[3][4]\nCarbon nitride[3]\nOxalic acid dinitrile[4]\nDicyanogen\nNitriloacetonitrile\nOxalyl cyanide","CAS Number":"460-19-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"1732464","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29308 Y","ChemSpider":"9605 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.006.643","EC Number":"207-306-5","Gmelin Reference":"1090","MeSH":"cyanogen","PubChem CID":"9999","RTECS number":"GT1925000","UN number":"1026","Chemical formula":"(CN)<sub>2</sub>","Appearance":"Colourless gas","Odor":"pungent, almond-like","Density":"950 mg mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (at &#x2212;21&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−28 °C (−18 °F; 245 K)","Boiling point":"−21.1 °C; −6.1 °F; 252.0 K","Solubility in water":"45 g/100 mL (at 20 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, ethyl ether","Vapor pressure":"5.1 atm (21 °C)[5]","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"1.9 μmol Pa−1 kg−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-21.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.327 (18 °C)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"241.57 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"309.07 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−1.0978–−1.0942 MJ mol−1","Main hazards":"forms cyanide in the body; flammable[5]","Safety data sheet":"inchem.org","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"F+  T  N","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12, R23, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S16, S33, S45, S63","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n2","Explosive limits":"6.6–32%[5]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[5]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 ppm (20 mg/m3)[5]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[5]","Related alkanenitriles":"Hydrogen cyanide\nThiocyanic acid\nCyanogen iodide\nCyanogen bromide\nCyanogen chloride\nCyanogen fluoride\nCyanogen azide\nAcetonitrile\nAminoacetonitrile\nGlycolonitrile\nPropionitrile\nAminopropionitrile\nMalononitrile\nPivalonitrile\nAcetone cyanohydrin","Related compounds":"DBNPA","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
