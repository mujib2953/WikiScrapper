{"name":"Calcium sulfide","desc":"Calcium sulfide is the chemical compound with the formula CaS. This white material crystallizes in cubes like rock salt. CaS has been studied as a component in a process that would recycle gypsum, a product of flue-gas desulfurization. Like many salts containing sulfide ions, CaS typically has an odour of H2S, which results from small amount of this gas formed by hydrolysis of the salt.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium sulfide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Calcium-sulfide-3D-balls.png/200px-Calcium-sulfide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_sulfide","IUPAC name":"Calcium sulfide","Other names":"Calcium monosulfide,\nHepar calcies,\nSulfurated lime\nOldhamite","CAS Number":"20548-54-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"8373113 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.869","EC Number":"243-873-5","KEGG":"C17392 N","PubChem CID":"10197613","UNII":"1MBW07J51Q N","Chemical formula":"CaS","Molar mass":"72.143 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystals\nhygroscopic","Density":"2.59 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,525 °C (4,577 °F; 2,798 K)","Solubility in water":"slightly soluble","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohol\nreacts with acid","Refractive index (nD)":"2.137","Crystal structure":"Halite (cubic), cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (Ca2+); octahedral (S2−)","Main hazards":"H2S source","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Irritant (Xi)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R31, R36/37/38, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S28, S61","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n1","Other anions":"Calcium oxide","Other cations":"Magnesium sulfide\nStrontium sulfide\nBarium sulfide","Related sulfides":"Sodium sulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
