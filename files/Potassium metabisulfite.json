{"name":"Potassium metabisulfite","desc":"Potassium metabisulfite, K2S2O5, also known as potassium pyrosulfite, is a white crystalline powder with a pungent sulfur odour. The main use for the chemical is as an antioxidant or chemical sterilant. It is a disulfite and is chemically very similar to sodium metabisulfite, with which it is sometimes used interchangeably. Potassium metabisulfite is generally preferred out of the two as it does not contribute sodium to the diet.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium metabisulfite","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Potassium-metabisulfite-2D.png/200px-Potassium-metabisulfite-2D.png"},{"alt":"Potassium metabisulfite ball-and-stick.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Potassium_metabisulfite_ball-and-stick.png/200px-Potassium_metabisulfite_ball-and-stick.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_metabisulfite","Other names":"Potassium pyrosulfite\nDipotassium disulfite","CAS Number":"16731-55-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"26061 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.037.072","E number":"E224 (preservatives)","PubChem CID":"28019","RTECS number":"TT4920000","UNII":"65OE787Q7W Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Potassium\">K</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"222.31 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White crystalline powder","Odor":"pungent (sulfur dioxide)","Density":"2.34 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (solid)","Melting point":"190 °C (374 °F; 463 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"450 g/l (20 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in ethanol","Main hazards":"Irritant, asthma risk","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1175","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36 R37 R38","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Other anions":"Potassium bisulfite\nPotassium sulfite","Other cations":"Sodium metabisulfite","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
