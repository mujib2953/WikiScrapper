{"name":"Andalusite","desc":"\nAndalusite is an aluminium nesosilicate mineral with the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Andalusite is trimorphic with kyanite and sillimanite, being the lower pressure mid temperature polymorph. At higher temperatures and pressures, andalusite may convert to sillimanite. Thus, as with its other polymorphs, andalusite is an aluminosilicate index mineral, providing clues to depth and pressures involved in producing the host rock.","images":[{"alt":"AndalousiteTyrol.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/AndalousiteTyrol.jpg/260px-AndalousiteTyrol.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Andalusite"}
