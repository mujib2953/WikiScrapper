{"name":"Nickel tetracarbonyl","desc":"Nickel carbonyl (IUPAC name: tetracarbonylnickel) is the organonickel compound with the formula Ni(CO)4. This pale-yellow liquid is the principal carbonyl of nickel. It is an intermediate in the Mond process for the purification of nickel and a reagent in organometallic chemistry. Nickel carbonyl is one of the most toxic substances encountered in industrial processes.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel carbonyl","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Nickel-carbonyl-2D.png/150px-Nickel-carbonyl-2D.png"},{"alt":"Nickel carbonyl","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Nickel-carbonyl-3D-balls.png/75px-Nickel-carbonyl-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel_tetracarbonyl","":"","IUPAC name":"Tetracarbonylnickel","Other names":"Nickel tetracarbonyl\nNickel carbonyl","CAS Number":"13463-39-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30372 Y","ChemSpider":"21865021 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.322","EC Number":"236-669-2","PubChem CID":"26039","RTECS number":"QR6300000","UN number":"1259","Chemical formula":"Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"170.73 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless or very-pale-yellow liquid[1]\ndiamagnetic","Odor":"musty,[1] like brick dust","Density":"1.319 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−17.2 °C (1.0 °F; 256.0 K)","Boiling point":"43 °C (109 °F; 316 K)","Solubility in water":"0.018 g/100 mL (10 °C)","Solubility":"miscible in most organic solvents\nsoluble in nitric acid, aqua regia","Vapor pressure":"315 mmHg (20 °C)[1]","Viscosity":"3.05 x 10−4 Pa s","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral","Molecular shape":"Tetrahedral","Dipole moment":"zero","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"320 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−632 kJ/mol","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−1180 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0064","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Flammable (F)\nCarc.
