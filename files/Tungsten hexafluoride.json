{"name":"Tungsten hexafluoride","desc":"Tungsten(VI) fluoride, also known as tungsten hexafluoride, is the inorganic compound of tungsten and fluorine with the formula WF6. This corrosive, colorless compound is a gas under standard conditions, with a density of about 13 g/L (roughly 11 times heavier than air.), WF6 is one of the heaviest known gases under standard conditions. WF6 gas is most commonly used in the production of semiconductor circuits and circuit boards through the process of chemical vapor deposition – upon decomposition, molecules of WF6 leave a residue of metallic tungsten. This layer serves as low-resistive metallic \"interconnect\".","images":[{"alt":"Tungsten(VI) fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Wolframhexafluorid.svg/100px-Wolframhexafluorid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tungsten(VI)_fluoride","":"","IUPAC names":"Tungsten hexafluoride\nTungsten(VI) fluoride","CAS Number":"7783-82-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.117","PubChem CID":"522684","Chemical formula":"WF<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"297.830 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless gas","Density":"12.4 g/L (gas)<br>\n4.56 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (&#x2212;9 &#xB0;C, solid)","Melting point":"2.3 °C (36.1 °F; 275.4 K)","Boiling point":"17.1 °C (62.8 °F; 290.2 K)","Solubility in water":"Hydrolyzes","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−40.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Molecular shape":"Octahedral","Dipole moment":"zero","Main hazards":"Toxic, corrosive; gives HF on contact with water","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Tungsten hexachloride\nTungsten hexabromide","Other cations":"Chromium(VI) fluoride\nMolybdenum(VI) fluoride","Related compounds":"Tungsten(IV) fluoride\nTungsten(V) fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
