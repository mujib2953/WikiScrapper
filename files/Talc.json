{"name":"Talc","desc":"Talc or talcum is a clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula H2Mg3(SiO3)4 or Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. In loose form, it was one of the most widely used substances known as baby powder, along with corn starch. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form. It has a perfect basal cleavage, and the folia are not elastic, although slightly flexible.","images":[{"alt":"Talc-usa10b.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Talc-usa10b.jpg/260px-Talc-usa10b.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Talc"}
