{"name":"Selenium tetrafluoride","desc":"Selenium tetrafluoride (SeF4) is an inorganic compound. It is a colourless liquid that reacts readily with water. It can be used as a fluorinating reagent in organic syntheses (fluorination of alcohols, carboxylic acids or carbonyl compounds) and has advantages over sulfur tetrafluoride in that milder conditions can be employed and it is a liquid rather than a gas.","images":[{"alt":"Selenium-tetrafluoride-gas-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Selenium-tetrafluoride-gas-3D-balls.png/200px-Selenium-tetrafluoride-gas-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Selenium_tetrafluoride","CAS Number":"13465-66-2 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30435 Y","ChemSpider":"109914 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.352","PubChem CID":"123311","Chemical formula":"SeF<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"154.954 g/mol","Appearance":"colourless liquid","Density":"2.77 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−13.2 °C (8.2 °F; 259.9 K)","Boiling point":"101 °C (214 °F; 374 K)","NFPA 704":"3\n2\nW","Other anions":"selenium dioxide, selenium(IV) chloride, selenium(IV) bromide","Other cations":"sulfur tetrafluoride, tellurium(IV) fluoride","Related compounds":"selenium difluoride, selenium hexafluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
