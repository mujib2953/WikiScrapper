{"name":"Thorium dioxide","desc":"Thorium dioxide (ThO2), also called thorium(IV) oxide, is a crystalline solid, often white or yellow in color. Also known as thoria, it is produced mainly as a by-product of lanthanide and uranium production. Thorianite is the name of the mineralogical form of thorium dioxide. It is moderately rare and crystallizes in an isometric system. The melting point of thorium oxide is 3300 °C – the highest of all known oxides. Only a few elements (including tungsten and carbon) and a few compounds (including tantalum carbide) have higher melting points. All thorium compounds are radioactive.","images":[{"alt":"Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png/200px-Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Thorium(IV)_oxide","IUPAC names":"Thorium dioxide\nThorium(IV) oxide","Other names":"thoria\nthorium anhydride","CAS Number":"1314-20-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.842","PubChem CID":"14808","Chemical formula":"ThO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"264.04 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"10.00 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"3,390 °C (6,130 °F; 3,660 K)","Boiling point":"4,400 °C (7,950 °F; 4,670 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"insoluble in alkali\nslightly soluble in acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−16.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.200 (thorianite)","Crystal structure":"Fluorite (cubic), cF12","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Lattice constant":"a = 559.74(6) pm[1]","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (O2−); cubic (ThIV)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"65.2(2) J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1226(4) kJ/mol","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"400 mg/kg","Other cations":"Hafnium(IV) oxide\nCerium(IV) oxide","Related compounds":"Protactinium(IV) oxide\nUranium(IV) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
