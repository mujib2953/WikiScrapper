{"name":"Aspirin","desc":"Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a medication used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which it is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but it is also an antiplatelet and suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.","images":[{"alt":"Aspirin-skeletal.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Aspirin-skeletal.svg/100px-Aspirin-skeletal.svg.png"},{"alt":"Aspirin-B-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Aspirin-B-3D-balls.png/125px-Aspirin-B-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aspirin"}
