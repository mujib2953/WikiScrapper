{"name":"Lithium hydroxide","desc":"Lithium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula LiOH. It is a white hygroscopic crystalline material. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol, and is available commercially in anhydrous form and as the monohydrate (LiOH.H2O), both of which are strong bases. It is the weakest base among the alkali metal hydroxides.","images":[{"alt":"Lithium hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Lithium-hydroxide-xtal-3D-SF.png/200px-Lithium-hydroxide-xtal-3D-SF.png"},{"alt":"Lithium-hydroxide.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Lithium_hydroxide.jpg/200px-Lithium_hydroxide.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Lithium_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Lithium hydroxide","Other names":"Lithine","CAS Number":"1310-65-2 Y\n1310-66-3 (monohydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33979 Y","ChemSpider":"3802 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.804","Gmelin Reference":"68415","PubChem CID":"3939","RTECS number":"OJ6307070","UNII":"903YL31JAS Y","UN number":"2680","Chemical formula":"LiOH","Molar mass":"23.95 g/mol (anhydrous)\n41.96 g/mol (monohydrate)","Appearance":"hygroscopic white solid\nodorless","Density":"1.46 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.51 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (monohydrate)","Melting point":"462 °C (864 °F; 735 K)","Boiling point":"924 °C (1,695 °F; 1,197 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"anhydrous:\n\n12.7 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n12.8 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n17.5 g/100 mL (100 °C)\nmonohydrate:\n\n22.3 g/100 mL (10 °C)\n26.8 g/100 mL (80 °C)[1]","Solubility in methanol":"anhydrous:\n\n9.76 g/100 g (20 °C, 48 hours mixing)\nmonohydrate:\n\n13.69 g/100 g (20 °C, 48 hours mixing)[2]","Solubility in ethanol":"anhydrous:\n\n2.36 g/100 g (20 °C, 48 hours mixing)\nmonohydrate:\n\n2.18 g/100 g (20 °C, 48 hours mixing)[2]","Solubility in isopropanol":"anhydrous:\n\n0 g/100 g (20 °C, 48 hours mixing)\nmonohydrate:\n\n0.11 g/100 g (20 °C, 48 hours mixing)[2]","Basicity (pKb)":"−0.04[3](LiOH(aq) = Li+ + OH–)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−12.3·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.464 (anhydrous)\n1.460 (monohydrate)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"2.071 J/g K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-20.36 kJ/g","Main hazards":"Corrosive","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0913\nICSC 0914 (monohydrate)","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"210 mg/kg (oral, rat)[4]","Other anions":"Lithium amide","Other cations":"Sodium hydroxide\nPotassium hydroxide\nRubidium hydroxide\nCaesium hydroxide","Related compounds":"Lithium oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
