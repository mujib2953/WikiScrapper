{"name":"2-Pyridone","desc":"2-Pyridone is an organic compound with the formula C\n5H\n4NH(O). This colourless crystalline solid is used in peptide synthesis. It is well known to form hydrogen bonded structures somewhat related to the base-pairing mechanism found in RNA and DNA. It is also a classic case of a molecule that exists as tautomers.","images":[{"alt":"2-Pyridone","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/2-pyridone.svg/150px-2-pyridone.svg.png"},{"alt":"2-Pyridone molecule (lactam form)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/2-Pyridone-%28lactam%29-3D-balls.png/100px-2-Pyridone-%28lactam%29-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/2-pyridone","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Pyridin-2(1H)-one\nPyridin-2(1H)-one","Other names":"2(1H)-Pyridinone\n2(1H)-Pyridone\n1H-Pyridine-2-one\n2-Pyridone\n1,2-Dihydro-2-oxopyridine\n1H-2-Pyridone\n2-Oxopyridone\n2-Pyridinol\n2-Hydroxypyridine","CAS Number":"142-08-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16540 Y","ChemSpider":"8537 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.019","RTECS number":"UV1144050","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"95.10 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colourless crystalline solid","Density":"1.39 g/cm&#xB3;","Melting point":"107.8 °C (226.0 °F; 380.9 K)","Boiling point":"280 °C (536 °F; 553 K) decomp.","Solubility in other solvents":"Soluble in water,\nmethanol, acetone","Acidity (pKa)":"11.65","UV-vis (λmax)":"293 nm (ε 5900, H2O soln)","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic","Molecular shape":"planar","Dipole moment":"4.26 D","Main hazards":"irritating","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36 R37 R38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26 S37/39","NFPA 704":"1\n2","Flash point":"210 °C (410 °F; 483 K)","Other anions":"2-Pyridinolate","Other cations":"2-Hydroxypyridinium-ion","Related functional groups":"alcohol, lactam, lactim,\npyridine, ketone","Related compounds":"pyridine, thymine, cytosine,\nuracil, benzene","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
