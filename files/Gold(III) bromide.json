{"name":"Gold(III) bromide","desc":"Gold(III) bromide is a dark-red to black crystalline solid. It has the empirical formula AuBr3, but exists primarily as a dimer with the molecular formula Au2Br6 in which two gold atoms are bridged by two bromine atoms. It is commonly referred to as gold(III) bromide, gold tribromide, and rarely but traditionally auric bromide, and sometimes as digold hexabromide. As is similar with the other gold halides, this compound is unique for being a coordination complex of a group 11 transition metal that is stable in an oxidation state of three whereas copper or silver complexes persist in oxidation states of one or two.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of gold(III) bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Gold-tribromide-dimer-3D-balls.png/200px-Gold-tribromide-dimer-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of gold(III) bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Gold-tribromide-dimer-3D-vdW.png/200px-Gold-tribromide-dimer-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Gold_tribromide","IUPAC name":"Gold(III) bromide","Other names":"Auric bromide\nGold bromide\nGold(III) bromide\nGold tribromide\nDigold hexabromide","CAS Number":"10294-28-7 N\n11092-53-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30079 Y","ChemSpider":"9548892 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.582","PubChem CID":"82525","UNII":"4PJV3VH75Y N","Chemical formula":"AuBr<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"436.69 g/mol","Appearance":"dark red to black crystalline","Melting point":"97.5 °C (207.5 °F; 370.6 K)","NFPA 704":"3","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
