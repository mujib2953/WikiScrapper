{"name":"Hippuric acid","desc":"Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid found in the urine of horses and other herbivores. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that influence levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of hippuric acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Hippuric_acid.png/200px-Hippuric_acid.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the hippuric acid molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Hippuric_acid_3D_ball.png/200px-Hippuric_acid_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hippuric_acid","IUPAC name":"Benzoylaminoethanoic acid","Other names":"Hippuric acid, N-benzoylglycine, benzoyl glycocoll, benzoyl amidoacetic acid","CAS Number":"495-69-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18089 Y","ChemSpider":"451 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.098","KEGG":"C01586 Y","PubChem CID":"464","UNII":"TE0865N2ET Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"179.17 g/mol","Density":"1,371 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"187 to 188 °C (369 to 370 °F; 460 to 461 K)","Boiling point":"240 °C (464 °F; 513 K) (decomposes)","Safety data sheet":"Material Safety Data Sheet","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
