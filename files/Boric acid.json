{"name":"Boric acid","desc":"Boric acid, also called hydrogen borate, boracic acid, orthoboric acid and acidum boricum, is a weak, monobasic Lewis acid of boron often used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other chemical compounds. It has the chemical formula H3BO3 (sometimes written B(OH)3), and exists in the form of colorless crystals or a white powder that dissolves in water. When occurring as a mineral, it is called sassolite.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Boric-acid-2D.png/100px-Boric-acid-2D.png"},{"alt":"Boric acid crystals","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Boric_acid.jpg/150px-Boric_acid.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Boric_acid","":"","IUPAC names":"Boric acid\nTrihydrooxidoboron","Other names":"Orthoboric acid,\nBoracic acid,\nSassolite,\nOptibor,\nBorofax,\nTrihydroxyborane,\nBoron(III) hydroxide,\nBoron Trihydroxide","CAS Number":"10043-35-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33118 Y","ChemSpider":"7346 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.114","EC Number":"233-139-2","E number":"E284 (preservatives)","KEGG":"D01089 Y","PubChem CID":"7628","UNII":"R57ZHV85D4 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Boron\">B</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"61.83 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White crystalline solid","Density":"1.435 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"170.9 °C (339.6 °F; 444.0 K)","Boiling point":"300 °C (572 °F; 573 K)","Solubility in water":"2.52 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n4.72 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n5.7 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n19.10 g/100 mL (80 °C)\n27.53 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility in other solvents":"Soluble in lower alcohols\nmoderately soluble in pyridine\nvery slightly soluble in acetone","Acidity (pKa)":"9.24, 12.4, 13.3","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-34.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Molecular shape":"Trigonal planar","Dipole moment":"Zero","ATC code":"S02AA03 (WHO) D08AD (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Xn","R-phrases (outdated)":"R60 R61","S-phrases (outdated)":"S53 S45","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2660 mg/kg, oral (rat)","Related compounds":"Boron trioxide\nBorax","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
