{"name":"Yttrium(III) fluoride","desc":"Yttrium(III) fluoride is an inorganic chemical compound with the chemical formula YF3. It is not known naturally in 'pure' form. The fluoride minerals containing essential yttrium include tveitite-(Y) (Y,Na)6Ca6Ca6F42 and gagarinite-(Y) NaCaY(F,Cl)6. Sometimes mineral fluorite contains admixtures of yttrium.","images":[{"alt":"Yttrium(III) fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Kristallstruktur_Yttrium%28III%29-fluorid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Yttrium%28III%29-fluorid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Yttrium_fluoride","Other names":"yttrium trifluoride","CAS Number":"13709-49-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"75502 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.855","PubChem CID":"83679","Chemical formula":"YF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"145.90 g mol−1","Appearance":"white powder","Density":"4.01 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"1,387 °C (2,529 °F; 1,660 K)","Boiling point":"2,230 °C (4,050 °F; 2,500 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility in acid":"soluble","Refractive index (nD)":"1.51 (500 nm)","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP16, SpaceGroup = Pnma, No. 62","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Yttrium(III) chloride\nYttrium(III) bromide\nYttrium(III) iodide","Other cations":"Scandium(III) fluoride\nLanthanum(III) fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
