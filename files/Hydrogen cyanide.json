{"name":"Hydrogen cyanide","desc":"Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sometimes called prussic acid, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 °C (78.1 °F). HCN is produced on an industrial scale and is a highly valuable precursor to many chemical compounds ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals.","images":[{"alt":"Hydrogen-cyanide-2D.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Hydrogen-cyanide-2D.svg/200px-Hydrogen-cyanide-2D.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of hydrogen cyanide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Hydrogen-cyanide-3D-balls.png/100px-Hydrogen-cyanide-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrocyanic_acid","":"","IUPAC name[1][2]":"Formonitrile[1] (substitutive)\nHydridonitridocarbon[2] (additive)\n\n\n\n\nFormonitrile[1] (substitutive)\nHydridonitridocarbon[2] (additive)","Other names":"Formic anammonide\nHydrocyanic acid\nPrussic acid\nMethanenitrile\n\n\n\n\nFormic anammonide\nHydrocyanic acid\nPrussic acid\nMethanenitrile","CAS Number":"74-90-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","3DMet":"B00275","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18407 N","ChemSpider":"748 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.747","EC Number":"200-821-6","KEGG":"C01326 N","MeSH":"Hydrogen+Cyanide","PubChem CID":"768","RTECS number":"MW6825000","UNII":"2WTB3V159F Y","UN number":"1051","Chemical formula":"HCN","Molar mass":"27.0253 g/mol","Appearance":"Very pale, blue, transparent liquid or colorless gas","Odor":"Oil of bitter almond","Density":"0.687 g mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>","Melting point":"−14 to −12 °C; 7 to 10 °F; 259 to 261 K","Boiling point":"25.6 to 26.6 °C; 78.0 to 79.8 °F; 298.7 to 299.7 K","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Solubility in ethanol":"Miscible","Vapor pressure":"630 mmHg (20 °C)[3]","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"75 μmol Pa−1 kg−1","Acidity (pKa)":"9.21[4]","Basicity (pKb)":"4.79","Refractive index (nD)":"1.2675 [5]","Viscosity":"201 μPa s","Point group":"C∞v","Molecular shape":"Linear","Dipole moment":"2.98 D","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"71.00 kJ K−1 mol−1 (at 27 °C)[6]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"113.01 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"109.9 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"-426.5 kJ mol−1","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H319, H336","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P261, P305+351+338","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n2","Flash point":"−17.8 °C (0.0 °F; 255.3 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"538 °C (1,000 °F; 811 K)","Explosive limits":"5.6% – 40.0%[3]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"501 ppm (rat, 5 min)\n323 ppm (mouse, 5 min)\n275 ppm (rat, 15 min)\n170 ppm (rat, 30 min)\n160 ppm (rat, 30 min)\n323 ppm (rat, 5 min)[7]","LCLo (lowest published)":"200 ppm (mammal, 5 min)\n36 ppm (mammal, 2 hr)\n107 ppm (human, 10 min)\n759 ppm (rabbit, 1 min)\n759 ppm (cat, 1 min)\n357 ppm (human, 2 min)\n179 ppm (human, 1 hr)[7]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 10 ppm (11 mg/m3) [skin][3]","REL (Recommended)":"ST 4.7 ppm (5 mg/m3) [skin][3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"50 ppm[3]","Related alkanenitriles":"Hydrogen isocyanide\nIsocyanic acid\nThiocyanic acid\nCyanogen iodide\nCyanogen bromide\nCyanogen chloride\nCyanogen fluoride\nAcetonitrile\nAminoacetonitrile\nGlycolonitrile\nCyanogen","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
