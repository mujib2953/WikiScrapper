{"name":"Perbromic acid","desc":"The compound perbromic acid is the inorganic compound with the formula HBrO4. It is an oxoacid of bromine. Perbromic acid is unstable and cannot be formed by displacement of chlorine from perchloric acid, as periodic acid is prepared; it can only be made by protonation of the perbromate ion.","images":[{"alt":"Perbromic-acid-3D-vdW.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Perbromic-acid-3D-vdW.png/200px-Perbromic-acid-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Perbromic_acid","CAS Number":"19445-25-1 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29245 Y","ChemSpider":"167074 Y","PubChem CID":"192513","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Bromine\">Br</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"144.908","Melting point":"decomposes before melting, unstable as solid","Main hazards":"powerful oxidizer","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
