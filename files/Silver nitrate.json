{"name":"Silver nitrate","desc":"Silver nitrate is an inorganic compound with chemical formula AgNO\n3. This compound is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, such as those used in photography. It is far less sensitive to light than the halides. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the moon.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of silver nitrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Silver-nitrate-2D.svg/160px-Silver-nitrate-2D.svg.png"},{"alt":"Sample of silver nitrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Silver_nitrate_crystals.jpg/160px-Silver_nitrate_crystals.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Silver_nitrate","IUPAC name":"Silver(I) nitrate, Silver nitrate","Other names":"Nitric acid silver(1+) salt\nLapis infernalis","CAS Number":"7761-88-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:32130 Y","ChemSpider":"22878 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.958","EC Number":"231-853-9","PubChem CID":"24470","RTECS number":"VW4725000","UNII":"95IT3W8JZE Y","UN number":"1493","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Silver\">Ag</span><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"169.87 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless solid","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"4.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (24&#xA0;&#xB0;C)<br>\n3.97 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (210&#xA0;&#xB0;C)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"209.7 °C (409.5 °F; 482.8 K)[1][3]","Boiling point":"440 °C (824 °F; 713 K)\ndecomposes[1]","Solubility in water":"122 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n170 g/100 mL (10 °C)\n256 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n373 g/100 mL (40 °C)\n912 g/100 mL (100 °C)[2]","Solubility":"Soluble in acetone,[1] ammonia, ether, glycerol","Solubility in acetic acid":"0.776 g/kg (30 °C)\n1.244 g/kg (40 °C)\n5.503 g/kg (93 °C)[3]","Solubility in acetone":"0.35 g/100 g (14 °C)\n0.44 g/100 g (18 °C)[2]","Solubility in benzene":"0.22 g/kg (35 °C)\n0.44 g/kg (40.5 °C)[2]","Solubility in ethanol":"3.1 g/100 g (19 °C)[2]","Solubility in ethyl acetate":"2.7 g/100 g (20 °C)[3]","log P":"0.19[4]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−45.7·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.744","Viscosity":"3.77 cP (244 °C)\n3.04 cP (275 °C)[3]","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP56[5]","Space group":"P212121, No. 19[5]","Point group":"222[5]","Lattice constant":"a = 6.992(2) Å, b = 7.335(2) Å, c = 10.125(2) Å[5]\nα = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"93.1 J/mol·K[1]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"140.9 J/mol·K[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−124.4 kJ/mol[1]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"−33.4 kJ/mol[1]","ATC code":"D08AL01 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Explosively reacts with ethanol.
