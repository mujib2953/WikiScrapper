{"name":"Hydrogen","desc":"Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1. With a standard atomic weight of circa 7000100800000000000♠1.008, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.","images":[{"alt":"Hydrogen discharge tube.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Hydrogen_discharge_tube.jpg/220px-Hydrogen_discharge_tube.jpg"},{"alt":"Hydrogen Spectra.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Hydrogen_Spectra.jpg/220px-Hydrogen_Spectra.jpg"},{"alt":"Hydrogen (diatomic nonmetal)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Transparent.gif"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrogen","":"","– ← hydrogen → helium":"‍"}
