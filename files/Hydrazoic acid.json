{"name":"Hydrazoic acid","desc":"Hydrazoic acid, also known as hydrogen azide or azoimide, is a compound with the chemical formula HN3. It is a colorless, volatile, and explosive liquid at room temperature and pressure. It is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, and is therefore a pnictogen hydride. It was first isolated in 1890 by Theodor Curtius. The acid has few applications, but its conjugate base, the azide ion, is useful in specialized processes.","images":[{"alt":"Structure, bonding and dimensions of the hydrogen azide molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Hydrogen-azide-2D-dimensions.png/200px-Hydrogen-azide-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Hydrazoic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Hydrazoic_acid.svg/200px-Hydrazoic_acid.svg.png"},{"alt":"Hydrazoic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Hydrogen-azide-3D-vdW.png/200px-Hydrogen-azide-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrazoic_acid","IUPAC name":"Hydrogen azide","CAS Number":"7782-79-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29449 Y","ChemSpider":"22937 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.059","PubChem CID":"24530","Chemical formula":"HN<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"43.03 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless, highly volatile liquid","Density":"1.09 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−80 °C (−112 °F; 193 K)","Boiling point":"37 °C (99 °F; 310 K)","Solubility in water":"highly soluble","Solubility":"soluble in alkali, alcohol, ether","Acidity (pKa)":"4.6 [1]","Molecular shape":"approximately linear","Main hazards":"Highly toxic, explosive, reactive","R-phrases (outdated)":"R3, R27/28","S-phrases (outdated)":"S33, S36/37, S38","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n2","Other cations":"Sodium azide","Related nitrogen hydrides":"Ammonia\nHydrazine","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
