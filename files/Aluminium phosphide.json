{"name":"Aluminium phosphide","desc":"Aluminium phosphide (aluminum phosphide) is a highly toxic inorganic compound with the chemical formula AlP used as a wide band gap semiconductor and a fumigant. This colorless solid is generally sold as a grey-green-yellow powder due to the presence of impurities arising from hydrolysis and oxidation.","images":[{"alt":"Aluminium phosphide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Sphalerite-unit-cell-depth-fade-3D-balls.png/200px-Sphalerite-unit-cell-depth-fade-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_monophosphide","Other names":"Aluminum phosphide\nAluminium(III) phosphide\nAluminium monophosphide\nPhostoxin\nFumitoxin","CAS Number":"20859-73-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"28171 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.040.065","EC Number":"244-088-0","PubChem CID":"30332","RTECS number":"BD1400000","UNII":"E23DR6L59S Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Aluminium\">Al</span><span title=\"Phosphorus\">P</span>","Molar mass":"57.9552 g/mol","Appearance":"Yellow or gray crystals","Odor":"garlic-like","Density":"2.85 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,530 °C (4,590 °F; 2,800 K)","Solubility in water":"reacts","Band gap":"2.5 eV (indirect)[1]","Refractive index (nD)":"2.75 (IR), ~3 (Vis) [1]","Crystal structure":"Zincblende","Space group":"T2d-F43m","Lattice constant":"a = 546.35 pm","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"47.3 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-164.4 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"T\n N","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n2\nW","Flash point":"> 800 °C (1,470 °F; 1,070 K)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"11.5 mg/kg","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
