{"name":"Tin selenide","desc":"Tin selenide, also known as stannous selenide, is an inorganic compound with the formula (SnSe), where Tin has a +2 oxidation state. Tin(II) selenide is a narrow band-gap (IV-VI) semiconductor and has received considerable interest for applications including low-cost photovoltaics and memory-switching devices. Tin(II) selenide is a typical layered metal chalcogenide; that is, it includes a Group 16 anion (Se2−) and an electropositive element (Sn2+), and it is arranged in a layered structure.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Tin(II)_selenide","Other names":"Tin(II) selenide","CAS Number":"1315-06-6 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.871","EC Number":"215-257-6","PubChem CID":"6432049","Chemical formula":"SnSe","Molar mass":"197.67 g/mol","Appearance":"steel gray odorless powder","Density":"6.179 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"861 °C (1,582 °F; 1,134 K)","Solubility in water":"negligible","Band gap":"0.9 eV (indirect), 1.3 eV (direct)[1]","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP8[1]","Space group":"Pnma, No. 62[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-88.7 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"https://www.ltschem.com/msds/SnSe.pdf","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Toxic (T)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R23/25, R33, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S20/21, S28, S45, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n1","Other anions":"Tin(II) oxide\nTin(II) sulfide\nTin telluride","Other cations":"Carbon monoselenide\nSilicon monoselenide\nGermanium selenide\nLead selenide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
