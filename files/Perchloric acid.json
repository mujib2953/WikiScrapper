{"name":"Perchloric acid","desc":"Perchloric acid is a mineral acid with the formula HClO4. Usually found as an aqueous solution, this colorless compound is a stronger acid than sulfuric and nitric acid. It is a powerful oxidizer when hot, but its aqueous solutions up to approximately 70% by weight at room temperature are generally safe, only showing strong acid features and no oxidizing properties. Perchloric acid is useful for preparing perchlorate salts, especially ammonium perchlorate, an important rocket fuel component. Perchloric acid is dangerously corrosive and readily forms potentially explosive mixtures.","images":[{"alt":"Perchloric acidHydroxidotrioxidochlorine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Perchloric-acid-2D-dimensions.png/100px-Perchloric-acid-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Perchloric acid 60 percent.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Perchloric_acid_60_percent.jpg/200px-Perchloric_acid_60_percent.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Perchloric_acid","":"","Systematic IUPAC name":"chloric(VII) acid\nchloric(VII) acid","[1]":"Hyperchloric acid[1]","CAS Number":"7601-90-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29221 Y","ChemSpider":"22669 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.648","EC Number":"231-512-4","PubChem CID":"24247","RTECS number":"SC7500000","UN number":"1873","Chemical formula":"HClO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"100.46 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless liquid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.768 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−17 °C (1 °F; 256 K) (azeotrope)[4]\n-112 °C (anhydrous)","Boiling point":"203 °C (397 °F; 476 K) (azeotrope)[2]","Solubility in water":"miscible","Acidity (pKa)":"-15.2 (±2.0);[3] ≈ −10","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1006","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Oxidant (O)\nCorrosive (C)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R5, R8, R35","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S23, S26, S36, S45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n3\nOX","Related compounds":"Hydrochloric acid\nHypochlorous acid\nChlorous acid\nChloric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
