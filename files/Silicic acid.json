{"name":"Silicic acid","desc":"Silicic acid /sɪˈlɪsɪk ˌæsɪd/ is a chemical compound. Silicic acid is the general name for a family of chemical compounds containing the element silicon attached to oxide and hydroxyl groups. This family of compounds have the general formula [SiOx(OH)4-2x]n. Some simple silicic acids have been identified, but only in very dilute aqueous solution, such as metasilicic acid (H2SiO3), orthosilicic acid (H4SiO4, pKa1=9.84, pKa2=13.2 at 25 °C), disilicic acid (H2Si2O5)[citation needed], and pyrosilicic acid (H6Si2O7); however in the solid state these probably condense to form polymeric silicic acids of complex structure.","images":[{"alt":"Metasilicic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0_H2SiO3.JPG/250px-%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0_H2SiO3.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Silicic_acid","IUPAC name":"Silicic acid","Other names":"Monosilicic acid\nOrthosilicic acid","CAS Number":"1343-98-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:26675 Y","ChemSpider":"14236 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.109.340","EC Number":"233-477-0","Gmelin Reference":"2009","PubChem CID":"14942","UNII":"623B93YABH N","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Silicon\">Si</span>","Molar mass":"96.11 g·mol−1","Acidity (pKa)":"9.84, 13.2","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−42.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Related compounds":"Orthocarbonic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
