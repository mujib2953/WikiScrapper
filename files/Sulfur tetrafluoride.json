{"name":"Sulfur tetrafluoride","desc":"Sulfur tetrafluoride is the chemical compound with the formula SF4. This species exists as a gas at standard conditions. It is a corrosive species that releases dangerous HF upon exposure to water or moisture. Despite these unwelcome characteristics, this compound is a useful reagent for the preparation of organofluorine compounds, some of which are important in the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of sulfur tetrafluoride, showing dimernsions","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Sulfur-tetrafluoride-2D-dimensions.png/200px-Sulfur-tetrafluoride-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of sulfur tetrafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Sulfur-tetrafluoride-3D-balls.png/100px-Sulfur-tetrafluoride-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sulfur_tetrafluoride","":"","IUPAC name":"Sulfur(IV) fluoride","Other names":"Sulfur tetrafluoride","CAS Number":"7783-60-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30495 Y","ChemSpider":"22961 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.103","PubChem CID":"24555","RTECS number":"WT4800000","UN number":"2418","Chemical formula":"SF<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"108.07 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless gas","Density":"1.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, &#x2212;78 &#xB0;C","Melting point":"−121.0 °C","Boiling point":"−38 °C","Solubility in water":"reacts","Vapor pressure":"10.5 atm (22°C)[1]","Molecular shape":"Seesaw (C2v)","Dipole moment":"0.632 D[2]","Main hazards":"highly toxic\ncorrosive","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1456","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2\nW","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[1]","REL (Recommended)":"C 0.1 ppm (0.4 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[1]","Other anions":"Sulfur dichloride\nDisulfur dibromide\nSulfur trifluoride","Other cations":"Oxygen difluoride\nSelenium tetrafluoride\nTellurium tetrafluoride\nPolonium tetrafluoride","Related sulfur fluorides":"Disulfur difluoride\nSulfur difluoride\nDisulfur decafluoride\nSulfur hexafluoride","Related compounds":"Thionyl fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
