{"name":"Arsenic pentoxide","desc":"Arsenic pentoxide is the inorganic compound with the formula As2O5. This glassy, white, deliquescent solid is relatively unstable, consistent with the rarity of the As(V) oxidation state. More common, and far more important commercially, is arsenic(III) oxide (As2O3). All arsenic compounds are highly toxic and thus find only limited commercial applications.","images":[{"alt":"Arsenic pentoxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Arsenic-pentoxide-3D-polyhedra.png/200px-Arsenic-pentoxide-3D-polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Arsenic_pentoxide","Other names":"Arsenic(V) oxide\nArsenic oxide\nArsenic anhydride","CAS Number":"1303-28-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"14088 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.743","EC Number":"215-116-9","PubChem CID":"14771","RTECS number":"CG2275000","Chemical formula":"As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"229.8402 g/mol","Appearance":"white hygroscopic powder","Density":"4.32 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"315 °C (599 °F; 588 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"59.5 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n65.8 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n8.20 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol","Acidity (pKa)":"7","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Very toxic (T+)\nCarc.
