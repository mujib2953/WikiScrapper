{"name":"Manganese(II) chloride","desc":"Manganese(II) chloride describes a series of compounds with the formula MnCl2(H2O)x, where the value of x can be 0, 2, or 4. The tetrahydrate is the most common form of \"manganese(II) chloride\" and is the tetrahydrate with the formula MnCl2·4H2O. The anhydrous form and a dihydrate MnCl2·2H2O are also known. Like many Mn(II) species, these salts are pink, with the paleness of the color being characteristic of transition metal complexes with high spin d5 configurations.","images":[{"alt":"Cis-MnCl2(H2O)4.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Cis-MnCl2%28H2O%294.png/200px-Cis-MnCl2%28H2O%294.png"},{"alt":"Manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Manganese%28II%29_chloride_tetrahydrate.jpg/200px-Manganese%28II%29_chloride_tetrahydrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Manganese(II)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Manganese(II) chloride\nManganese dichloride","Other names":"Manganous chloride\nhyperchloride of managnese","CAS Number":"7773-01-5 Y\n38639-72-4 (dihydrate) Y\n13446-34-9 (tetrahydrate) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22888 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.972","PubChem CID":"24480","RTECS number":"OO9625000","UNII":"6YB4901Y90 Y","Chemical formula":"MnCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"125.844 g/mol (anhydrous)\n161.874 g/mol (dihydrate)\n197.91 g/mol (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"pink solid (tetrahydrate)","Density":"2.977 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.27 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)<br>\n2.01 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahydrate)","Melting point":"654 °C (1,209 °F; 927 K) (anhydrous)\ndihydrate dehydrates at 135 °C\ntetrahydrate dehydrates at 58 °C","Boiling point":"1,225 °C (2,237 °F; 1,498 K)","Solubility in water":"63.4 g/100 ml (0 °C)\n73.9 g/100 ml (20 °C)\n88.5 g/100 ml (40 °C)\n123.8 g/100 ml (100 °C)","Solubility":"slightly soluble in pyridine, soluble in ethanol\ninsoluble in ether","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+14,350·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"CdCl2","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"250-275 mg/kg (rat, oral)[citation needed]\n1715 mg/kg (mouse, oral)[1]","Other anions":"Manganese(II) fluoride\nManganese(II) bromide\nManganese(II) iodide","Other cations":"Manganese(III) chloride\nTechnetium(IV) chloride\nRhenium(III) chloride\nRhenium(IV) chloride\nRhenium(V) chloride\nRhenium(VI) chloride","Related compounds":"Chromium(II) chloride\nIron(II) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
