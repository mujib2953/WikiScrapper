{"name":"Chloromethane","desc":"Chloromethane, also called methyl chloride, Refrigerant-40, R-40 or HCC 40, is a chemical compound of the group of organic compounds called haloalkanes. It was once widely used as a refrigerant. It is a colorless extremely flammable gas with a mildly sweet odor. Due to concerns about its toxicity, it is no longer present in consumer products. Chloromethane was first synthesized by the French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot in 1835 by boiling a mixture of methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium chloride. This method is similar to that used today.","images":[{"alt":"Stereo, skeletal formula of chloromethane with all explicit hydrogens added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Methyl_Chloride.svg/100px-Methyl_Chloride.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of chloromethane","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Chloromethane-3D-balls.png/100px-Chloromethane-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chloromethane","":"","IUPAC name[2]":"Chloromethane[2]","[1][1][1]":"Refrigerant-40\nR-40[1]\nMethyl chloride[1]\nMonochloromethane[1]\n\n\n\n\nRefrigerant-40\nR-40[1]\nMethyl chloride[1]\nMonochloromethane[1]","CAS Number":"74-87-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"1696839","ChEBI":"CHEBI:36014 Y","ChemSpider":"6087 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.744","EC Number":"200-817-4","Gmelin Reference":"24898","KEGG":"C19446 N","MeSH":"Methyl+Chloride","PubChem CID":"6327","RTECS number":"PA6300000","UNII":"A6R43525YO Y","UN number":"1063","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Chlorine\">Cl</span>","Molar mass":"50.49 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless gas","Odor":"Faint, sweet odor[3]","Density":"1.003 g/mL (-23.8&#xA0;&#xB0;C, liquid)<sup id=\"cite_ref-GESTIS_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GESTIS-1\">[1]</a></sup>2.3065 g/L (0&#xA0;&#xB0;C, gas)<sup id=\"cite_ref-GESTIS_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GESTIS-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−97.4 °C (−143.3 °F; 175.8 K)[1]","Boiling point":"−23.8 °C (−10.8 °F; 249.3 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"5.325 g L−1","log P":"1.113","Vapor pressure":"506.09 kPa (at 20 °C (68 °F))","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"940 nmol Pa−1 kg−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-32.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Coordination geometry":"Tetragonal","Molecular shape":"Tetrahedron","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"234.36 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−83.68 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−764.5–−763.5 kJ mol−1","Main hazards":"carcinogen","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H220, H351, H373","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P281, P410+403","NFPA 704":"4\n2\n0","Flash point":"−20 °C (−4 °F; 253 K)[1]","Autoignition\ntemperature":"625 °C (1,157 °F; 898 K)[1]","Explosive limits":"8.1%-17.4%[3]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1800 mg/kg (oral, rat)[1]\n5.3 mg/L/4 h (inhalation, rat)[1]","LC50 (median concentration)":"72,000 ppm (rat, 30 min)\n2200 ppm (mouse, 6 hr)\n2760 ppm (mammal, 4 hr)\n2524 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[4]","LCLo (lowest published)":"20,000 ppm (guinea pig, 2 hr)\n14,661 ppm (dog, 6 hr)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 100 ppm C 200 ppm 300 ppm (5-minute maximum peak in any 3 hours)[3]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [2000 ppm][3]","Related alkanes":"Chloroiodomethane\nBromochloromethane\nDibromochloromethane","Related compounds":"2-Chloroethanol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
