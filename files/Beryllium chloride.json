{"name":"Beryllium chloride","desc":"Beryllium chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula BeCl2. It is a colourless, hygroscopic solid that dissolves well in many polar solvents. Its properties are similar to those of aluminium chloride, due to beryllium's diagonal relationship with aluminium.","images":[{"alt":"Beryllium-chloride-xtal-3D-balls-A.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Beryllium-chloride-xtal-3D-balls-A.png/200px-Beryllium-chloride-xtal-3D-balls-A.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Beryllium_chloride","IUPAC name":"Beryllium chloride","CAS Number":"7787-47-5 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22991 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.197","PubChem CID":"24588","RTECS number":"DS2625000","Chemical formula":"BeCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"79.9182 g/mol","Appearance":"White or yellow crystals","Density":"1.899&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"399 °C (750 °F; 672 K)","Boiling point":"482 °C (900 °F; 755 K)","Solubility in water":"15.1 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ether, benzene, and pyridine\nslightly soluble in chloroform and sulfur dioxide","Crystal structure":"hexagonal","Molecular shape":"polymer","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"7.808 J/K or 71.1 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"63 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−6.136 kJ/g or -494 kJ/mol","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-468 kJ/mol","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"16 kJ/mol","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"86 mg/kg (rat, oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.002 mg/m3\nC 0.005 mg/m3 (30 minutes), with a maximum peak of 0.025 mg/m3 (as Be)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca C 0.0005 mg/m3 (as Be)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [4 mg/m3 (as Be)][1]","Other anions":"Beryllium fluoride\nBeryllium bromide\nBeryllium iodide","Other cations":"Magnesium chloride\nCalcium chloride\nStrontium chloride\nBarium chloride\nRadium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
