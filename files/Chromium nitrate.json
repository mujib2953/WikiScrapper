{"name":"Chromium nitrate","desc":"Chromium(III) nitrate describes several inorganic compounds consisting of chromium, nitrate and varying amounts of water. Most common is the dark violet hydrated solid, but an anhydrous green form is also known. Chromium(III) nitrate compounds are of a limited importance commercially, finding some applications in the dyeing industry. It is common in academic laboratories for the synthesis of chromium coordination complexes.","images":[{"alt":"Chromium nitrate.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Chromium_nitrate.svg/200px-Chromium_nitrate.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium_nitrate","IUPAC name":"Chromium(III) nitrate","Other names":"Nitric acid, chromium(3+) salt","CAS Number":"13548-38-4 Y\n7789-02-8 (nonahydrate) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"15285818 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.550","PubChem CID":"24598","RTECS number":"GB6300000","UNII":"C6H0RE016B Y","UN number":"2720","Chemical formula":"Cr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub><br>\n[Cr(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>](NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>&#x2022;3H<sub>2</sub>O (nonahydrate)","Molar mass":"238.011 g/mol (anhydrous)\n400.21 g/mol (nonahydrate)","Appearance":"Blue-violet crystals (anhydrous)\nPurple crystals (nonahydrate)","Density":"1.85 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (nonahydrate)","Melting point":"60.06 °C (140.11 °F; 333.21 K) nonahydrate","Boiling point":"> 100 °C (212 °F; 373 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"81 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Safety data sheet":"Oxford MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1\nOX","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"3250 mg/kg (rat, oral, nonahydrate)\n110 mg/kg (mouse, oral)[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
