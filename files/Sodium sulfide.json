{"name":"Sodium sulfide","desc":"Sodium sulfide is the chemical compound with the formula Na2S, or more commonly its hydrate Na2S·9H2O. Both are colorless water-soluble salts that give strongly alkaline solutions. When exposed to moist air, Na2S and its hydrates emit hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs. Some commercial samples are specified as Na2S·xH2O, where a weight percentage of Na2S is specified. Commonly available grades have around 60% Na2S by weight, which means that x is around 3. Such technical grades of sodium sulfide have a yellow appearance owing to the presence of polysulfides. These grades of sodium sulfide are marketed as 'sodium sulfide flakes'. Although the solid is yellow, solutions of it are colorless.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium sulfide.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Sodium_sulfide.jpg/200px-Sodium_sulfide.jpg"},{"alt":"Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png/200px-Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_monosulfide","Other names":"Disodium sulfide","CAS Number":"1313-82-2 Y\n1313-84-4 (pentahydrate) N\n1313-84-4 (nonahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:76208 N","ChemSpider":"14120 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.829","EC Number":"215-211-5","PubChem CID":"237873","RTECS number":"WE1905000","UN number":"1385 (anhydrous)\n1849 (hydrate)","Chemical formula":"Na<sub>2</sub>S","Molar mass":"78.0452 g/mol (anhydrous)\n240.18 g/mol (nonahydrate)","Appearance":"colorless, hygroscopic solid","Odor":"rotten eggs","Density":"1.856 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.58 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (pentahydrate)<br>\n1.43 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (nonohydrate)","Melting point":"1,176 °C (2,149 °F; 1,449 K) (anhydrous)\n100 °C (pentahydrate)\n50 °C (nonahydrate)","Solubility in water":"12.4 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n18.6 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n39 g/100 mL (50 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in ether\nslightly soluble in alcohol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−39.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Antifluorite (cubic), cF12","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (Na+); cubic (S2−)","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1047","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Corrosive (C)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R31, R34, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S26, S45, S61","NFPA 704":"1\n3\n1","Autoignition\ntemperature":"> 480 °C (896 °F; 753 K)","Other anions":"Sodium oxide\nSodium selenide\nSodium telluride","Other cations":"Lithium sulfide\nPotassium sulfide","Related compounds":"Sodium hydrosulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
