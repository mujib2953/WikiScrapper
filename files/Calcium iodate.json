{"name":"Calcium iodate","desc":"Calcium iodates are inorganic compound composed of calcium and iodate anion. Two forms are known, anhydrous Ca(IO3)2 and the hexahydrate Ca(IO3)2(H2O). Both are colourless salts that occur naturally as the minerals called lautarite and bruggenite, respectively. A third mineral form of calcium iodate is dietzeite, a salt containing chromate with the formula Ca2(IO3)2CrO4.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium iodate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Calcium_iodate.png/200px-Calcium_iodate.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_iodate","IUPAC name":"Calcium diiodate","Other names":"Lautarite","CAS Number":"7789-80-2 (anhydrous) N\n10031-33-1 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23021 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.265","EC Number":"232-191-3","E number":"E916 (glazing agents, ...)","PubChem CID":"24619","Chemical formula":"Ca(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"389.88 g/mol (anhydrous)\n407.90 g/mol (monohydrate)","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"4.519 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (monohydrate)","Melting point":"540 °C (1,004 °F; 813 K) (monohydrate)","Boiling point":"decomposes","Solubility in water":"0.09 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n0.24 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n0.67 g/100 mL (90 °C)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"7.1×10−7","Solubility":"soluble in nitric acid\ninsoluble in alcohol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-101.4·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"monoclinic (anhydrous)\ncubic (monohydrate)\northorhombic (hexahydrate)","Flash point":"non-flammable","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
