{"name":"Formic acid","desc":"Formic acid, systemically named methanoic acid, is the simplest carboxylic acid. The chemical formula is HCOOH or HCO2H. It is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and occurs naturally, most notably in some ants. The word \"formic\" comes from the Latin word for ant, formica, referring to its early isolation by the distillation of ant bodies, and the trivial name in some languages means \"ant-acid\", such as Dutch mierenzuur, Danish myresyre, Faroese meyrusýra and German Ameisensäure. Esters, salts, and the anions derived from formic acid are called formates.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal structure of formic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Formic_acid.svg/100px-Formic_acid.svg.png"},{"alt":"Formic acid 85 percent.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Formic_acid_85_percent.jpg/120px-Formic_acid_85_percent.jpg"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Formic_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Formic acid[1]\nFormic acid[1]","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"Methanoic acid[1]\nMethanoic acid[1]","Other names":"Carbonous acid; Formylic acid; Hydrogen carboxylic acid; Hydroxy(oxo)methane; Metacarbonoic acid; Oxocarbinic acid; Oxomethanol","CAS Number":"64-18-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30751 Y","ChemSpider":"278 Y","DrugBank":"DB01942 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.527","EC Number":"200-579-1","E number":"E236 (preservatives)","KEGG":"C00058 Y","PubChem CID":"284","RTECS number":"LQ4900000","UNII":"0YIW783RG1 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"46.03 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless fuming liquid","Odor":"Pungent, penetrating","Density":"1.220 g/mL","Melting point":"8.4 °C (47.1 °F; 281.5 K)","Boiling point":"100.8 °C (213.4 °F; 373.9 K)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Solubility":"Miscible with ether, acetone, ethyl acetate, glycerol, methanol, ethanol\nPartially soluble in benzene, toluene, xylenes","log P":"−0.54","Vapor pressure":"35 mmHg (20 °C)[2]","Acidity (pKa)":"3.77[3]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-19.90·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3714 (20 °C)","Viscosity":"1.57 cP at 268 °C","Molecular shape":"Planar","Dipole moment":"1.41 D (gas)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"131.8 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−425.0 kJ/mol","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−254.6 kJ/mol","ATCvet code":"QP53AG01 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Corrosive; irritant;\nsensitizer","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nJT Baker","R-phrases (outdated)":"R10 R35","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2) S23 S26 S45","NFPA 704":"2\n3\n1","Flash point":"69 °C (156 °F; 342 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"601 °C (1,114 °F; 874 K)","Explosive limits":"14–34%[citation needed]\n18%–57% (90% solution)[2]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"700 mg/kg (mouse, oral), 1100 mg/kg (rat, oral), 4000 mg/kg (dog, oral)[4]","LC50 (median concentration)":"7853 ppm (rat, 15 min)\n3246 ppm (mouse, 15 min)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5 ppm (9 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 5 ppm (9 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"30 ppm[2]","Related carboxylic acids":"Acetic acid\nPropionic acid","Related compounds":"Formaldehyde\nMethanol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
