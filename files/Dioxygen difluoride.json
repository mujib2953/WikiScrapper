{"name":"Dioxygen difluoride","desc":"Dioxygen difluoride is a compound of fluorine and oxygen with the molecular formula O\n2F\n2. It can exist as an orange-colored solid which melts into a red liquid at −163 °C (110 K). It is an extremely strong oxidant and decomposes into oxygen and fluorine even at −160 °C (113 K) at a rate of 4% per day: its lifetime at room temperature is thus extremely short. Dioxygen difluoride reacts vigorously with nearly every chemical it encounters – even ordinary ice – leading to its onomatopoeic nickname \"FOOF\" (a play on its chemical structure and its explosive tendencies).","images":[{"alt":"Stick model of dioxygen difluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Fluorine_dioxide.svg/100px-Fluorine_dioxide.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Dioxygen_difluoride","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Dioxygen difluoride\nDioxygen difluoride","Systematic IUPAC name":"Fluorooxy hypofluorite\nFluorooxy hypofluorite","Other names":"Monofluorooxygenyl hypofluorite\nDifluorine dioxide\nFluorine dioxide\nPerfluoroperoxide\nFluorine peroxide\nDifluorine peroxide\nFOOF\nFluoroperoxyl fluoride\n\n\n\n\nMonofluorooxygenyl hypofluorite\nDifluorine dioxide\nFluorine dioxide\nPerfluoroperoxide\nFluorine peroxide\nDifluorine peroxide\nFOOF\nFluoroperoxyl fluoride","CAS Number":"7783-44-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Abbreviations":"FOOF","ChEBI":"CHEBI:47866 Y","ChemSpider":"109870 Y","Gmelin Reference":"1570","PubChem CID":"123257","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">O<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span>F<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span></span>","Molar mass":"69.996 g·mol−1","Appearance":"orange as a solid","Density":"1.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (at b.p.)","Melting point":"−154 °C (−245 °F; 119 K)","Boiling point":"−57 °C (−71 °F; 216 K) extrapolated","Solubility in other solvents":"decomposes","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"62.1 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"277.2 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"19.2 kJ/mol","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"58.2 kJ/mol","Related compounds":"O\n3F\n2\nH\n2O\n2\nOF\n2\nFClO\n2\nCl\n2O\n2\nS\n2Cl\n2\nS\n2F\n2","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
