{"name":"Monosodium phosphate","desc":"Monosodium phosphate (MSP), also known as monobasic sodium phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate, is an inorganic compound of sodium with dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4−) anion. One of many sodium phosphates, it is a common industrial chemical. The salt exists in an anhydrous form, as well as mono- and dihydrates.","images":[{"alt":"Monosodium phosphate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Monosodium_phosphate.png/150px-Monosodium_phosphate.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the dihydrogenphosphate anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/2-dihydrogenphosphate-3D-balls.png/140px-2-dihydrogenphosphate-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Dihydrogenfosforečnan sodný.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Dihydrogenfosfore%C4%8Dnan_sodn%C3%BD.JPG/200px-Dihydrogenfosfore%C4%8Dnan_sodn%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Monosodium_phosphate","IUPAC name":"Sodium dihydrogen phosphate","Other names":"monobasic sodium phosphate;\nsodium dihydrogen phosphate;\nsodium biphosphate","CAS Number":"7558-80-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:37585 Y","ChemSpider":"22626 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.591","PubChem CID":"24204","UNII":"KH7I04HPUU N","Chemical formula":"NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"119.98 g/mol","Appearance":"White powder or crystals","Density":"2.36 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)","Solubility in water":"59.90 g/100 mL (0°C)","NFPA 704":"0\n0\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other cations":"Monopotassium phosphate\nMonoammonium phosphate","Related compounds":"Disodium phosphate\nTrisodium phosphate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
