{"name":"Biphenyl","desc":"Biphenyl (or diphenyl or phenylbenzene or 1,1′-biphenyl or lemonene) is an organic compound that forms colorless crystals. Particularly in older literature, compounds containing the functional group consisting of biphenyl less one hydrogen (the site at which it is attached) may use the prefixes xenyl or diphenylyl.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Bifenyl.svg/200px-Bifenyl.svg.png"},{"alt":"Space filling model showing its twisted conformation","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Biphenyl_3D.png/200px-Biphenyl_3D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Biphenyl","Preferred IUPAC name":"1,1'-Biphenyl\n1,1'-Biphenyl","Other names":"Biphenyl\nPhenyl benzene","CAS Number":"92-52-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17097 Y","ChemSpider":"6828 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.001.967","E number":"E230 (preservatives)","KEGG":"C06588 Y","PubChem CID":"7095","UNII":"2L9GJK6MGN Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>12</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>10</sub>","Molar mass":"154.21 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless to pale-yellow crystals","Odor":"pleasant[1]","Density":"1.04 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-GESTIS_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GESTIS-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"69.2 °C (156.6 °F; 342.3 K)[2]","Boiling point":"255 °C (491 °F; 528 K)[2]","Solubility in water":"4.45 mg/L[2]","Vapor pressure":"0.005 mmHg (20°C)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−103.25·10−6 cm3/mol","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Irritant (Xi)\nDangerous for\nthe environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36/37/38 R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2) S23 S60 S61","NFPA 704":"1\n1\n0","Flash point":"113 °C (235 °F; 386 K)[2]","Autoignition\ntemperature":"540 °C (1,004 °F; 813 K)[2]","Explosive limits":"0.6–5.8%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2400 mg/kg (oral, rabbit)\n3280 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n1900 mg/kg (oral, mouse)\n2400 mg/kg (oral, rat)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"100 mg/m3[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
