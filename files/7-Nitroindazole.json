{"name":"7-Nitroindazole","desc":"7-Nitroindazole, or 7-NI, is a heterocyclic small molecule containing an indazole ring that has been nitrated at the 7 position. Nitroindazole acts as a selective inhibitor for neuronal nitric oxide synthase, a hemoprotein enzyme that, in neuronal tissue, converts arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide can diffuse through the plasma membrane into neighbouring cells, allowing cell signalling, so nitroindazole indirectly inhibits this signalling process. Other inhibitors exist such as 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole, which is more potent but less specific, or NPA (N-propyl-L-arginine), which acts on a different site.","images":[{"alt":"Structure of 7-Nitroindazole.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Structure_of_7-Nitroindazole.png/150px-Structure_of_7-Nitroindazole.png"}],"link":"/wiki/7-nitroindazole","IUPAC name":"7-nitro-1H-indazole","CAS Number":"2942-42-9 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"1821 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.019.032","IUPHAR/BPS":"5127","PubChem CID":"1893","Chemical formula":"C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"163.1335","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
