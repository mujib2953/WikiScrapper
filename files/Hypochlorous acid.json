{"name":"Hypochlorous acid","desc":"Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is a weak acid that forms when chlorine dissolves in water, and itself partially dissociates, forming ClO-. HClO and ClO- are oxidizers, and the primary disinfection agents of chlorine solutions. HClO cannot be isolated from these solutions due to rapid equilibration with its precursor. Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)2), are bleaches, deodorants, and disinfectants.","images":[{"alt":"hypochlorous acid bonding","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Hypochlorous-acid-2D-dimensions.svg/150px-Hypochlorous-acid-2D-dimensions.svg.png"},{"alt":"hypochlorous acid space filling","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Hypochlorous-acid-3D-vdW.svg/150px-Hypochlorous-acid-3D-vdW.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hypochlorous_acid","IUPAC name":"hypochlorous acid, chloric(I) acid, chloranol, hydroxidochlorine","Other names":"Hydrogen hypochlorite, Chlorine hydroxide","CAS Number":"7790-92-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:24757 Y","ChemSpider":"22757 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.302","EC Number":"232-232-5","PubChem CID":"24341","UNII":"712K4CDC10 Y","Chemical formula":"HOCl","Molar mass":"52.46 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless aqueous solution","Density":"Variable","Solubility in water":"Soluble","Acidity (pKa)":"7.53[1]","Main hazards":"Oxidizing agent","Related compounds":"Chlorine\nCalcium hypochlorite\nSodium hypochlorite","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
