{"name":"Barium peroxide","desc":"Barium peroxide is the inorganic compound with the formula BaO2. This white solid (gray when impure) is one of the most common inorganic peroxides, and it was the first peroxide compound discovered. Being an oxidizer and giving a vivid green colour upon ignition (as do all barium compounds), it finds some use in fireworks; historically, it was also used as a precursor for hydrogen peroxide.","images":[{"alt":"Peroxid barnatý.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Peroxid_barnat%C3%BD.JPG/200px-Peroxid_barnat%C3%BD.JPG"},{"alt":"BaO2structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/BaO2structure.jpg/200px-BaO2structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_peroxide","IUPAC name":"barium peroxide","Other names":"Barium binoxide,\nBarium dioxide","CAS Number":"1304-29-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"14090 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.754","EC Number":"215-128-4","PubChem CID":"14773","RTECS number":"CR0175000","Chemical formula":"BaO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"169.33 g/mol (anhydrous)\n313.45 (octahydrate)","Appearance":"Grey-white crystalline (anhydrous)\ncolorless solid (octahydrate)","Odor":"odorless","Density":"5.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous) 2.292 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (octahydrate)","Melting point":"450 °C (842 °F; 723 K)","Boiling point":"800 °C (1,470 °F; 1,070 K) (decomposes to BaO & O2.[1])","Solubility in water":"anhydrous\n\n0.091 g/100 mL (20 °C)\noctahydrate\n\n0.168 g/cm3","Solubility":"dissolves with decomposition in acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-40.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Tetragonal [2]","Space group":"D174h, I4/mmm, tI6","Coordination geometry":"6","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"O\n Xn","R-phrases (outdated)":"R8, R20/22","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S13, S27","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n2\nOX","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
