{"name":"Cerium(IV) sulfate","desc":"Cerium(IV) sulfate, also called ceric sulfate, is an inorganic compound. It exists as the anhydrous salt Ce(SO4)2 as well as a few hydrated forms: Ce(SO4)2(H2O)x, with x equal to 4, 8, or 12. These salts are yellow to yellow/orange solids that are moderately soluble in water and dilute acids. Its neutral solutions slowly decompose, depositing the light yellow oxide CeO2. Solutions of ceric sulfate have a strong yellow color. The tetrahydrate loses water when heated to 180-200 °C.","images":[{"alt":"Cerium(IV) sulfate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Cer%28IV%29-sulfat.JPG/200px-Cer%28IV%29-sulfat.JPG"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cerium(IV)_sulfate","Other names":"Ceric sulfate","CAS Number":"13590-82-4 Y\n10294-42-5 (tetrahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"140403 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.648","PubChem CID":"159684","UNII":"4F66FI5T7X N","Chemical formula":"Ce(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"332.24 g/mol (anhydrous)\n404.304 (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"Yellow solid (anhydrous)\nyellow-orange crystals (tetrahydrate)","Density":"3.91 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahydrate)","Melting point":"350 °C (662 °F; 623 K) (decomposes)","Boiling point":"NA","Solubility in water":"Soluble in small amounts, hydrolyzes in large amounts of water\n21.4 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n9.84 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n3.87 g/100 mL (60 °C)[1]","Solubility":"soluble in dilute sulfuric acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+37.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic","Main hazards":"Oxidizer","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
