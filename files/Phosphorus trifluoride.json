{"name":"Phosphorus trifluoride","desc":"Phosphorus trifluoride (formula PF3), is a colorless and odorless gas. It is highly toxic and reacts slowly with water. Its main use is as a ligand in metal complexes. As a ligand, it parallels carbon monoxide in metal carbonyls, and indeed its toxicity is due to its binding with the iron in blood hemoglobin in a similar way to carbon monoxide.","images":[{"alt":"Structure and dimensions of phosphorus trifluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Phosphorus-trifluoride-2D-dimensions.png/100px-Phosphorus-trifluoride-2D-dimensions.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Phosphorus_trifluoride","":"","IUPAC names":"Phosphorus trifluoride\nPhosphorus(III) fluoride\nTrifluorophosphane\nTrifluoridophosphorus","Other names":"Trifluorophosphine\nPhosphorous fluoride","CAS Number":"7783-55-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30205 Y","ChemSpider":"56416 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.098","PubChem CID":"62665","RTECS number":"TH3850000","Chemical formula":"PF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"87.968971 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless gas","Density":"3.91 g/L, gas","Melting point":"−151.5 °C (−240.7 °F; 121.6 K)","Boiling point":"−101.8 °C (−151.2 °F; 171.3 K)","Solubility in water":"slow hydrolysis","Molecular shape":"Trigonal pyramidal","Dipole moment":"1.03 D","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Phosphorus trichloride\nPhosphorus tribromide\nPhosphorus triiodide\nPhosphane","Other cations":"Nitrogen trifluoride\nArsenic trifluoride\nAntimony trifluoride\nBismuth trifluoride","Related ligands":"Carbon monoxide","Related compounds":"Phosphorus pentafluoride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
