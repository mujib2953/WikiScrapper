{"name":"Lanthanum(III) bromide","desc":"Lanthanum(III) bromide (LaBr3) is an inorganic halide salt of lanthanum. When pure, it is a colorless white powder. The single crystals of LaBr3 are hexagonal crystals with melting point of 783 °C. It is highly hygroscopic and water-soluble. There are several hydrates, La3Br·x H2O, of the salt also known. It is often used as a source of lanthanum in chemical synthesis, and is being evaluated for use as a scintillation material in certain applications.","images":[{"alt":"UCl3 without caption.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/UCl3_without_caption.png/100px-UCl3_without_caption.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lanthanum(III)_bromide","":"","IUPAC names":"Lanthanum(III) bromide\nLanthanum tribromide","CAS Number":"13536-79-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"75393 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.527","EC Number":"36-896-7","PubChem CID":"83563","Chemical formula":"LaBr<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"378.62 g/mol (anhydrous)","Appearance":"white solid, hygroscopic","Density":"5.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"783 °C (1,441 °F; 1,056 K)","Boiling point":"1,577 °C (2,871 °F; 1,850 K)","Solubility in water":"Not Published Yet (very soluble in water)","Crystal structure":"hexagonal (UCl3 type), hP8","Space group":"P63/m, No. 176","Coordination geometry":"Tricapped trigonal prismatic\n(nine-coordinate)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","Flash point":"not flammable","Other anions":"Lanthanum(III) fluoride\nLanthanum(III) chloride\nLanthanum(III) iodide","Other cations":"Cerium(III) bromide\nPraseodymium(III) bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
