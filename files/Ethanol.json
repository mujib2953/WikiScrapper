{"name":"Ethanol","desc":"Ethanol, also called alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and drinking alcohol, is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. It is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. Its chemical formula is C\n2H\n6O, which can be written also as CH\n3-CH\n2-OH or C\n2H\n5-OH (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH.","images":[{"alt":"Full structural formula of ethanol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Ethanol-2D-flat.png/100px-Ethanol-2D-flat.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of ethanol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Ethanol-3D-balls.png/100px-Ethanol-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ethanol","":"","Pronunciation":"/ˈɛθənɒl/","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"ethanol[1]\nethanol[1]","Other names":"Absolute alcohol, alcohol, cologne spirit, drinking alcohol, ethylic alcohol, EtOH, ethyl alcohol, ethyl hydrate, ethyl hydroxide, ethylol, grain alcohol, hydroxyethane, methylcarbinol","CAS Number":"64-17-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"1718733","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16236 Y","ChemSpider":"682 Y","DrugBank":"DB00898 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.526","E number":"E1510 (additional chemicals)","Gmelin Reference":"787","IUPHAR/BPS":"2299","PubChem CID":"702","UNII":"3K9958V90M Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"46.07 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Density":"0.7893 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (at 20 &#xB0;C)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc2_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc2-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−114.14 ± 0.03[2] °C (−173.45 ± 0.05 °F; 159.01 ± 0.03 K)","Boiling point":"78.24 ± 0.09[2] °C (172.83 ± 0.16 °F; 351.39 ± 0.09 K)","Solubility in water":"miscible","log P":"−0.18","Vapor pressure":"5.95 kPa (at 20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"15.9 (H2O), 29.8 (DMSO)[3][4]","Basicity (pKb)":"−1.9","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-33.60·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3611[2]","Viscosity":"1.2 mPa·s (at 20 °C), 1.074 mPa·s (at 25 °C)[5]","Dipole moment":"1.69 D[6]","Drug class":"Central nervous system depressant","ATC code":"D08AX08 (WHO) V03AB16 (WHO), V03AZ01 (WHO)","Pregnancy\ncategory":"US: C (Risk not ruled out) [12]","Dependence liability":"Moderate[14]","Addiction liability":"Moderate (10–15%)[13]","Routes of\nadministration":"Common: by mouth, topical\nUncommon: suppository, inhalation, ocular, insufflation,[7] injection[8]","Pharmacokinetics":"","Bioavailability":"Variable[9]","Metabolism":"Liver: alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme","Metabolites":"Acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetyl-CoA, carbon dioxide, water","Biological half-life":"None, constant rate elimination[10]","Excretion":"Urine, breath, perspiration, tears, milk, saliva, bile[10]","Legal status":"AU: Unscheduled\nCA: Unscheduled\nDE:  Unscheduled\nNZ: Unscheduled\nUK: Unscheduled\nUS: Unscheduled [11]\nUN: Unscheduled\nEU: Unscheduled","Related compounds":"Ethane\nMethanol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
