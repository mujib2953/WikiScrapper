{"name":"Aminothiazole","desc":"2-Aminothiazole is a heterocyclic amine featuring an thiazole core. It can also be considered a cyclic isothiourea. It possesses an odor similar to pyridine and is soluble in water, alcohols and diethyl ether. It is commonly used as a starting point for the synthesis of many compounds including sulfur drugs, biocides, fungicides, dyes and chemical reaction accelerators. 2-Aminothiazole can be used as a thyroid inhibitor in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and has antibacterial activity. Alternatively, its acid tartrate salt can be used. Recent studies using prion-infected neuroblastoma cell lines have suggested that aminothiazole may be used as a therapeutic drug for prion diseases.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of aminothiazole","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/2-aminothiazool.png/150px-2-aminothiazool.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the aminothiazole molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Aminothiazole-3D-spacefill.png/140px-Aminothiazole-3D-spacefill.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aminothiazole","IUPAC name":"1,3-thiazol-2-amine","Other names":"2-Thiazolamine, Aminothiazole, 2-Thiazylamine, Basedol, 2-Thiazolylamine, 4-Thiazolin-2-onimine, 2-Amino-1,3-thiazole, Abadole","CAS Number":"96-50-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:40782 N","ChemSpider":"2070 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.002.284","KEGG":"D02479 Y","PubChem CID":"2155","UNII":"5K8WKN668K Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"100.14 g·mol−1","Appearance":"light yellow crystals","Melting point":"86 to 89 °C (187 to 192 °F; 359 to 362 K)","Boiling point":"117 °C (243 °F; 390 K) (20 hPa)","Solubility in water":"100 g/l (20 °C)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-56.0·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Autoignition\ntemperature":"600 °C (1,112 °F; 873 K)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
