{"name":"Lithium cyanide","desc":"Lithium cyanide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula LiCN. It is a white powder at room temperature. Lithium cyanide is commonly used as a reagent in inorganic/organometallic reactions. Lithium cyanide can be found in the environment from the reaction of lithium and acetonitrile, both found in lithium sulfur oxide batteries. When the compound is exposed to the environment it can produce toxic fumes with weak acids found in nature.","images":[{"alt":"Lithium-cyanide-unit-cell-3D-SF.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Lithium-cyanide-unit-cell-3D-SF.png/200px-Lithium-cyanide-unit-cell-3D-SF.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lithium_cyanide","CAS Number":"2408-36-8","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"68007","ECHA InfoCard":"100.017.554","PubChem CID":"754-78","UN number":"1935","Chemical formula":"LiCN","Molar mass":"32.959 g/mol","Appearance":"White Powder","Density":"1.073 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (18 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"160 °C (320 °F; 433 K) Dark colored","Boiling point":"N/A","Solubility in water":"Soluble","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"N/A","Crystal structure":"-","Coordination geometry":"Fourfold","Safety data sheet":"742899","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"T+, Very Toxic N, Dangerous for the environment","R-phrases (outdated)":"26/27/28-32-50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"7-28-29-45-60-61","NFPA 704":"0\n4","Flash point":"57 °C (135 °F; 330 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"N/A","Related compounds":"Sodium cyanide, Potassium cyanide, Hydrogen cyanide"}
