{"name":"Capsaicin","desc":"Capsaicin (/kæpˈseɪ.ᵻsɪn/ (INN); 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi. Pure capsaicin is a non-volatile, hydrophobic, colorless, highly pungent, crystalline to waxy compound.","images":[{"alt":"Kapsaicyna.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Kapsaicyna.svg/200px-Kapsaicyna.svg.png"},{"alt":"Capsaicin-3D-vdW.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Capsaicin-3D-vdW.png/200px-Capsaicin-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Capsaicin","Preferred IUPAC name":"(6E)-N-[(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-8-methylnon-6-enamide\n(6E)-N-[(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-8-methylnon-6-enamide","Other names":"(E)-N-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methylnon-6-enamide\n8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-trans-6-nonenamide\ntrans-8-Methyl-N-vanillylnon-6-enamide\n(E)-Capsaicin\nCapsicine\nCapsicin\nCPS","CAS Number":"404-86-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:3374 Y","ChemSpider":"1265957 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.006.337","EC Number":"206-969-8","IUPHAR/BPS":"2486","KEGG":"C06866 Y","PubChem CID":"1548943","UNII":"S07O44R1ZM Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>18</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>27</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"305.42 g·mol−1","Appearance":"crystalline white powder[1]","Odor":"highly volatile and pungent","Melting point":"62 to 65 °C (144 to 149 °F; 335 to 338 K)","Boiling point":"210 to 220 °C (410 to 428 °F; 483 to 493 K) 0.01 Torr","Solubility in water":"0.0013 g/100 mL","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ether, benzene\nslightly soluble in CS2, HCl, petroleum","Vapor pressure":"6992132000000000000♠1.32×10−8 mm Hg at 7002298150000000000♠25 °C[2]","UV-vis (λmax)":"280 nm","Crystal structure":"monoclinic","ATC code":"M02AB01 (WHO) N01BX04 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Toxic (T)","Safety data sheet":"Capsaicin, Natural MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"R24/25","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26, S36/37/39, S45","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).","Infobox references":"","":""}
