{"name":"4-Aminobenzoic acid","desc":"4-Aminobenzoic acid (also known as para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA because the number 4 carbon in the benzene ring is also known as the para position) is an organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and a carboxyl groups. The compound occurs naturally.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of PABA","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/4-Aminobenzoic_acid.svg/100px-4-Aminobenzoic_acid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/4-aminobenzoic_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"4-Aminobenzoic acid\n4-Aminobenzoic acid","Other names":"para-Aminobenzoic acid\np-Aminobenzoic acid\nPABA\nVitamin B10\nVitamin Bx\nBacterial vitamin H1","CAS Number":"150-13-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30753 Y","ChemSpider":"953 Y","DrugBank":"DB02362 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.231","KEGG":"D02456 Y","PubChem CID":"978","UNII":"TL2TJE8QTX Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"137.14 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White-grey crystals","Density":"1.374 g/mL","Melting point":"187 to 189 °C (369 to 372 °F; 460 to 462 K)","Boiling point":"340 °C (644 °F; 613 K)","Solubility in water":"1 g/170 mL (25 °C)\n1 g/90 mL (90 °C)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
