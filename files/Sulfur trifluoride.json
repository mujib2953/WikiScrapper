{"name":"Sulfur trifluoride","desc":"Sulfur trifluoride is an inorganic chemical compound composed of one atom of sulfur and three atoms of fluorine. It has the chemical formula SF3, and is 64% fluorine and 36% sulfur by mass. Sulfur trifluoride is not a stable molecule: it has an unpaired electron and is thus a radical. While some radicals are stable, SF3 is not.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Sulfur_trifluoride","Other names":"sulfur(III) fluoride\ntrifluorosulfur radical","CAS Number":"30937-38-3 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Fluorine\">F</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"89.06 g·mol−1","Related compounds":"SF2, SF4, SF6, S2F10","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
