{"name":"2-Bromobutyric acid","desc":"2-Bromobutyric acid is an carboxylic acid with the molecular formula C4H7BrO2. It is a clear, yellow liquid. The 2-position is an asymmetric carbon, so there are two enantiomers of this compound. 2-Bromobutyric acid is mainly used as a building block chemical, such as in the preparation of Levetiracetam,[citation needed] an anticonvulsant medication.","images":[{"alt":"2-Bromobutyric acid-2D-by-AHRLS-2012.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/2-Bromobutyric_acid-2D-by-AHRLS-2012.png/150px-2-Bromobutyric_acid-2D-by-AHRLS-2012.png"},{"alt":"2-Bromobutyric acid-3D-balls-by-AHRLS-2012.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/2-Bromobutyric_acid-3D-balls-by-AHRLS-2012.png/150px-2-Bromobutyric_acid-3D-balls-by-AHRLS-2012.png"},{"alt":"2-Bromobutyric acid-3D-vdW-by-AHRLS-2012.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/2-Bromobutyric_acid-3D-vdW-by-AHRLS-2012.png/150px-2-Bromobutyric_acid-3D-vdW-by-AHRLS-2012.png"}],"link":"/wiki/2-bromobutyric_acid","":"","IUPAC name":"2-Bromobutyric acid","Systematic IUPAC name":"2-Bromobutanoic acid\n2-Bromobutanoic acid","Other names":"2-bromo-butanoicaci;alpha-Bromobytyric acid;Butanoic acid, 2-bromo-;Butyric acid, 2-bromo-;Butyric acid, alpha-bromo-;dl-2-Bromobutyric acid;dl-2-Bromobutyricacid;α-Bromobutyricacid","CAS Number":"80-58-0","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"6403","ECHA InfoCard":"100.001.177","PubChem CID":"6655","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Bromine\">Br</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"167.00 g·mol−1","Appearance":"clear, yellow liquid","Density":"1.567 g/mL at 25 &#xB0;C","Melting point":"−4 °C (25 °F; 269 K)","Boiling point":"99 to 103 °C (210 to 217 °F; 372 to 376 K) 10 mmHg","Solubility in water":"66 g/L (20 °C)","Vapor pressure":"0.0533 Torr","Acidity (pKa)":"2.95±0.10.
