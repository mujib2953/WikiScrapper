{"name":"Iron(II) chloride","desc":"Iron(II) chloride, also known as ferrous chloride, is the chemical compound of formula FeCl2. It is a paramagnetic solid with a high melting point. The compound is white, but typical samples are often off-white. FeCl2 crystallizes from water as the greenish tetrahydrate, which is the form that is most commonly encountered in commerce and the laboratory. There is also a dihydrate. The compound is also soluble in water; aqueous solutions of FeCl2 are highly transparent and pale green in color.","images":[{"alt":"Iron(II)-chloride-xtal-sheet-3D-balls-A.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Iron%28II%29-chloride-xtal-sheet-3D-balls-A.png/188px-Iron%28II%29-chloride-xtal-sheet-3D-balls-A.png"},{"alt":"Trans-FeCl2(H2O)4.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Trans-FeCl2%28H2O%294.png/144px-Trans-FeCl2%28H2O%294.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron(II)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Iron(II) chloride\nIron dichloride","Rokühnite":"Ferrous chloride,\nRokühnite","CAS Number":"7758-94-3 Y\n16399-77-2 (dihydrate) N\n13478-10-9 (tetrahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30812 Y","ChemSpider":"22866 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.949","EC Number":"231-843-4","PubChem CID":"24458","RTECS number":"NO5400000","UNII":"S3Y25PHP1W Y","Chemical formula":"FeCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"126.751 g/mol (anhydrous)\n198.8102 g/mol (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"tan solid (anhydrous)\npale green solid (di-tetrahydrate)","Density":"3.16 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.39 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)<br>\n1.93 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahydrate)","Melting point":"677 °C (1,251 °F; 950 K) (anhydrous)\n120 °C (dihydrate)\n105 °C (tetrahydrate) [1]","Boiling point":"1,023 °C (1,873 °F; 1,296 K) (anhydrous)","Solubility in water":"64.4 g/100 mL (10 °C),\n68.5 g/100mL (20 °C),\n105.7 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility in THF":"soluble","log P":"-0.15","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+14,750·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic","Coordination geometry":"octahedral at Fe","ATC code":"B03AA05 (WHO)","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","NIOSH":"","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[2]","Other anions":"Iron(II) fluoride\nIron(II) bromide\nIron(II) iodide","Other cations":"Cobalt(II) chloride\nManganese(II) chloride\nCopper(II) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
