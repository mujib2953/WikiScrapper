{"name":"Cobalt(II) hydroxide","desc":"Cobalt(II) hydroxide or cobaltous hydroxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Co(OH)2. It is a rose-red powder. An unstable blue form, so-called α-Co(OH)2, has also been reported. It is most used as a drying agent for paints, varnishes, and inks, in the preparation of other cobalt compounds, as a catalyst and in the manufacture of battery electrodes.","images":[{"alt":"Mg(OH)2Xray.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg/200px-Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg"},{"alt":"Red cobalt hydroxide.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Red_cobalt_hydroxide.JPG/200px-Red_cobalt_hydroxide.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Cobalt(II)_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Cobalt(II) hydroxide","Other names":"Cobaltous hydroxide, cobalt hydroxide, β-cobalt(II) hydroxide","CAS Number":"21041-93-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8305419 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.040.136","PubChem CID":"10129900","Chemical formula":"Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"92.948 g/mol","Appearance":"rose-red powder or bluish-green powder","Density":"3.597 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"168 °C (334 °F; 441 K) (decomposes)[1]","Solubility in water":"3.20 mg/L","Solubility product (Ksp)":"1.0×10−15","Solubility":"soluble in acids, ammonia; insoluble in dilute alkalis","Coordination geometry":"rhombohedral","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"79.0 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-539.7 kJ·mol−1","Safety data sheet":"Oxford University","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Xn","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20 R21 R22 R36 R37 R38 R43","S-phrases (outdated)":"S24 S26 S36 S37 S39[2]","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n2","Other anions":"Cobalt(II) chloride\nCobalt(II) bromide\nCobalt(II) iodide","Other cations":"Iron(II) hydroxide\nNickel(II) hydroxide\nCopper(II) hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
