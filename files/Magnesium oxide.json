{"name":"Magnesium oxide","desc":"Magnesium oxide (MgO), or magnesia, is a white hygroscopic solid mineral that occurs naturally as periclase and is a source of magnesium (see also oxide). It has an empirical formula of MgO and consists of a lattice of Mg2+ ions and O2− ions held together by ionic bonding. Magnesium hydroxide forms in the presence of water (MgO + H2O → Mg(OH)2), but it can be reversed by heating it to separate moisture.","images":[{"alt":"Magnesium oxide.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Magnesium_oxide.jpg/200px-Magnesium_oxide.jpg"},{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Magnesium_oxide","IUPAC name":"Magnesium oxide","Periclase":"Magnesia\nPericlase","CAS Number":"1309-48-4 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.793","EC Number":"215-171-9","E number":"E530 (acidity regulators, ...)","PubChem CID":"14792","RTECS number":"OM3850000","Chemical formula":"MgO","Molar mass":"40.304 g/mol[1]","Appearance":"White powder","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"3.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-b92_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-b92-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"2,825 °C (5,117 °F; 3,098 K)[1]","Boiling point":"3,600 °C (6,510 °F; 3,870 K)[1]","Solubility":"Soluble in acid, ammonia\ninsoluble in alcohol","Band gap":"7.8 eV[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−10.2·10−6 cm3/mol[3]","Thermal conductivity":"45–60 W·m−1·K−1[4]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.7355","Dipole moment":"6.2 ± 0.6 D","Crystal structure":"Halite (cubic), cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Lattice constant":"a = 4.212Å","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (Mg2+); octahedral (O2−)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"37.2 J/mol K[5]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"26.95 ± 0.15 J·mol−1·K−1[6]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−601.6 ± 0.3 kJ·mol−1[6]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-569.3 kJ/mol[5]","ATC code":"A02AA02 (WHO) A06AD02 (WHO), A12CC10 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Metal fume fever, Irritant","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0504","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36, R37, R38","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (fume)[7]","REL (Recommended)":"None designated[7]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"750 mg/m3 (fume)[7]","Other anions":"Magnesium sulfide","Other cations":"Beryllium oxide\nCalcium oxide\nStrontium oxide\nBarium oxide","Related compounds":"Magnesium hydroxide\nMagnesium nitride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
