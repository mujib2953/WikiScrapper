{"name":"Lysine","desc":"Lysine (abbreviated as Lys or K), encoded by the codons AAA and AAG, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain lysyl ((CH2)4NH2), classifying it as a charged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it and thus it must be obtained from the diet.","images":[{"alt":"Lysineph.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Lysineph.png/200px-Lysineph.png"},{"alt":"Skeletal formula of the L-monocation (positive polar form)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/L-lysine-monocation-2D-skeletal.png/100px-L-lysine-monocation-2D-skeletal.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lysine","":"","IUPAC name":"Lysine","Other names":"2,6-Diaminohexanoic acid; 2,6-Diammoniohexanoic acid","CAS Number":"70-54-2 DL N\n56-87-1 L Y\n923-27-3 D Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:25094 Y","ChemSpider":"843 Y\n5747 L Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.673","IUPHAR/BPS":"724","KEGG":"C16440 N","PubChem CID":"866","UNII":"K3Z4F929H6 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>14</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"146.19 g·mol−1","Solubility in water":"1.5kg/L @ 25 °C","ATC code":"B05XB03 (WHO)","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
