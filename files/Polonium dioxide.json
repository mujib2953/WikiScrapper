{"name":"Polonium dioxide","desc":"Polonium dioxide (also known as polonium(IV) oxide) is a chemical compound with the formula PoO2. It is one of three oxides of polonium, the other two being polonium monoxide (PoO) and polonium trioxide (PoO3). It is a pale yellow crystalline solid at room temperature. Under lowered pressure (such as a vacuum), it decomposes into elemental polonium and oxygen at 500 °C. It is the most stable oxide of polonium and is an interchalcogen.","images":[{"alt":"Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Polonium_dioxide","Systematic IUPAC name":"Polonium dioxide\nPolonium dioxide","CAS Number":"7446-06-2","UNII":"JC742031MY Y","Chemical formula":"PoO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"240.98 g/mol[1]","Appearance":"pale yellow crystalline solid[1][2][3]","Density":"8.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-CRC_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CRC-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"500 °C (932 °F; 773 K) (decomposes)[1][2]\nsublimes at 885 °C (under oxygen)[2][4]","Crystal structure":"fluorite, Pearson symbol cF12","Space group":"Fm3m (No 225)","Lattice constant":"a = 0.5637 nm[3]"}
