{"name":"Indole","desc":"Indole is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound with formula C8H7N. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. Indole is widely distributed in the natural environment and can be produced by a variety of bacteria. As an intercellular signal molecule, indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and virulence. The amino acid tryptophan is an indole derivative and the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula with numbering scheme","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Indole_2D_numbered.svg/160px-Indole_2D_numbered.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of indole","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Indole-3D-balls-2.png/155px-Indole-3D-balls-2.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of indole","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Indole-3D-spacefill.png/145px-Indole-3D-spacefill.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Indole","IUPAC name":"Indole","Other names":"2,3-Benzopyrrole, ketole,\n1-benzazole","CAS Number":"120-72-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16881 Y","ChemSpider":"776 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.004.019","KEGG":"C00463 Y","PubChem CID":"798","RTECS number":"NL2450000","UNII":"8724FJW4M5 Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N","Molar mass":"117.15 g/mol","Appearance":"White solid","Odor":"Feces or jasmine like","Density":"1.1747&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"52 to 54 °C (126 to 129 °F; 325 to 327 K)","Boiling point":"253 to 254 °C (487 to 489 °F; 526 to 527 K)","Solubility in water":"0.19 g/100 ml (20 °C)\nSoluble in hot water","Acidity (pKa)":"16.2\n(21.0 in DMSO)","Basicity (pKb)":"17.6","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-85.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Pna21","Molecular shape":"Planar","Dipole moment":"2.11 D in benzene","Safety data sheet":"[1]","R/S statement (outdated)":"R: 21/22-37/38-41-50/53\nS: 26-36/37/39-60-61","Flash point":"121 °C (250 °F; 394 K)","Related aromatic\ncompounds":"benzene, benzofuran,\ncarbazole, carboline,\nindene, indoline,\nisatin, methylindole,\noxindole, pyrrole,\nskatole","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
