{"name":"Calcium oxalate","desc":"Calcium oxalate (in archaic terminology, oxalate of lime) is a calcium salt of oxalic acid with the chemical formula CaC2O4. It is a chemical compound that forms envelope-shaped crystals, known in plants as raphides. A major constituent of human kidney stones, calcium oxalate is also found in beerstone, a scale that forms on containers used in breweries.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium oxalate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Calcium_oxalate_resonance.png/200px-Calcium_oxalate_resonance.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_oxalate","IUPAC name":"calcium ethanedioate","CAS Number":"25454-23-3 (anhydrous) Y\n5794-28-5 (monohydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:60579 Y","ChemSpider":"30549 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.008.419","PubChem CID":"16212978","Chemical formula":"CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"128.097 g/mol, anhydrous\n146.112 g/mol, monohydrate","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"2.12 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, anhydrous<br>\n2.12 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, monohydrate","Melting point":"200 °C (392 °F; 473 K) decomposes (monohydrate)","Solubility in water":"0.67 mg/L (20 °C)","Other cations":"Beryllium oxalate\nMagnesium oxalate\nStrontium oxalate\nBarium oxalate\nRadium oxalate\nIron(II) oxalate\nIron(III) oxalate","Related compounds":"Oxalic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
