{"name":"Histidine","desc":"Histidine (abbreviated as His or H; encoded by the codons CAU and CAC) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, longer-term studies have shown it is essential for adults also.","images":[{"alt":"L-Histidine physiological.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/L-Histidine_physiological.svg/175px-L-Histidine_physiological.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Histidine","":"","IUPAC name":"Histidine","Other names":"2-Amino-3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propanoic acid","CAS Number":"71-00-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:57595 Y","ChemSpider":"6038 Y","DrugBank":"DB00117 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.678","IUPHAR/BPS":"3310","KEGG":"D00032 Y","PubChem CID":"773","UNII":"4QD397987E Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"155.16 g·mol−1","Solubility in water":"4.19g/100g @ 25 °C [1]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","NFPA 704":"1\n1\n0","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
