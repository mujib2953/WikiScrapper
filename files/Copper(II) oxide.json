{"name":"Copper(II) oxide","desc":"Copper(II) oxide or cupric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula CuO. A black solid, it is one of the two stable oxides of copper, the other being Cu2O or cuprous oxide. As a mineral, it is known as tenorite and paramelaconite. It is a product of copper mining and the precursor to many other copper-containing products and chemical compounds.","images":[{"alt":"CopperIIoxide.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/CopperIIoxide.jpg/200px-CopperIIoxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Copper(II)-oxide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Copper%28II%29-oxide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Copper%28II%29-oxide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Copper(II)-oxide-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Copper%28II%29-oxide-3D-balls.png/200px-Copper%28II%29-oxide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(II)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Copper(II) oxide","Other names":"Cupric oxide","CAS Number":"1317-38-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:75955 N","ChemSpider":"144499 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.882","PubChem CID":"14829","RTECS number":"GL7900000","UNII":"V1XJQ704R4 Y","Chemical formula":"CuO","Molar mass":"79.545 g/mol","Appearance":"black to brown powder","Density":"6.315 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,326 °C (2,419 °F; 1,599 K)","Boiling point":"2,000 °C (3,630 °F; 2,270 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"soluble in ammonium chloride, potassium cyanide\ninsoluble in alcohol, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate","Band gap":"1.2 eV","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+238.9·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.63","Crystal structure":"monoclinic, mS8[1]","Space group":"C2/c, #15","Lattice constant":"a = 4.6837, b = 3.4226, c = 5.1288\nα = 90°, β = 99.54°, γ = 90°","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"43 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−156 kJ·mol−1","Safety data sheet":"Fischer Scientific","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","Other anions":"Copper(II) sulfide","Other cations":"Nickel(II) oxide\nZinc oxide","Related compounds":"Copper(I) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
