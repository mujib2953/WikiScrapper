{"name":"Calcium bromide","desc":"Calcium bromide is the name for compounds with the chemical formula CaBr2(H2O)x. Individual compounds include the anhydrous material (x = 0), the hexahydrate (x = 6), and the rare dihydrate (x = 2). All are white powders that dissolve in water, and from these solutions crystallizes the hexahydrate. The hydrated form is mainly used in some drilling fluids.","images":[{"alt":"Hydrophilite.GIF","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Hydrophilite.GIF/200px-Hydrophilite.GIF"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_bromide","IUPAC name":"Calcium bromide","Other names":"Calcium dibromide","CAS Number":"7789-41-5 anhydrous Y\n7774-34-7 hexahydrate N\n22208-73-7 dihydrate N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:31338 Y","ChemSpider":"23010 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.240","EC Number":"232-164-6","PubChem CID":"24608","RTECS number":"EV9328000","UNII":"87CNY2EEBH Y","Chemical formula":"CaBr<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"199.89 g/mol (anhydrous)\n235.98 g/mol (dihydrate)","Appearance":"anhydrous is hygroscopic colorless crystals\nsharp saline taste","Density":"3.353 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"730 °C (1,350 °F; 1,000 K)","Boiling point":"1,935 °C (3,515 °F; 2,208 K) (anhydrous)\n810 °C (dihydrate)","Solubility in water":"125 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n143 g/100 ml (20 °C)\n312 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility in alcohol, acetone":"soluble","Acidity (pKa)":"9","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-73.8·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"rhomboid","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"75 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"130 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-647.9 kJ/mol","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-656.1 kJ/mol","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"4100 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n1580 mg/kg (mouse, subcutaneous)","Other anions":"Calcium fluoride\nCalcium chloride\nCalcium iodide","Other cations":"Beryllium bromide\nMagnesium bromide\nStrontium bromide\nBarium bromide\nRadium bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
