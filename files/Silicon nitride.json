{"name":"Silicon nitride","desc":"Silicon nitride is a chemical compound of the elements silicon and nitrogen, with the formula Si\n3N\n4. It is a white, high-melting-point solid that is relatively chemically inert, being attacked by dilute HF and hot H\n2SO\n4. It is very hard (8.5 on the mohs scale). It is the most thermodynamically stable of the silicon nitrides. Hence, Si\n3N\n4 is the most commercially important of the silicon nitrides and is generally understood as what is being referred to where the term \"silicon nitride\" is used.","images":[{"alt":"Si3N4ceramics2.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Si3N4ceramics2.jpg/200px-Si3N4ceramics2.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Silicon_nitride","Preferred IUPAC name":"Silicon nitride\nSilicon nitride","Other names":"Nierite","CAS Number":"12033-89-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"2341213 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.620","EC Number":"234-796-8","MeSH":"Silicon+nitride","PubChem CID":"3084099","Chemical formula":"Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"140.28 g·mol−1","Appearance":"grey, odorless powder[1]","Density":"3.17 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-b92_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-b92-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"1,900 °C (3,450 °F; 2,170 K)[1] (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble[1]","Refractive index (nD)":"2.016[2]","Main hazards":"When heated to decomposition, silicon nitride may emit toxic fumes of ammonia and ozone.
