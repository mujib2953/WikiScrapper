{"name":"Cobalt(II) fluoride","desc":"Cobalt(II) fluoride is a chemical compound with the formula (CoF2). It is a pink crystalline solid compound which is antiferromagnetic at low temperatures (TN=37.7 K) The formula is given for both the red tetragonal crystal, (CoF2), and the tetrahydrate red orthogonal crystal, (CoF2·4H2O). CoF2 is used in oxygen-sensitive fields, namely metal production. In low concentrations, it has public health uses. CoF2 is sparingly soluble in water. The compound can be dissolved in warm mineral acid, and will decompose in boiling water. Yet the hydrate is water-soluble, especially the di-hydrate CoF2·2H2 O and tri-hydrate CoF2·3H2O forms of the compound. The hydrate will also decompose with heat.","images":[{"alt":"Fluorid kobaltnatý.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Fluorid_kobaltnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Fluorid_kobaltnat%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"Cobalt(II)-fluoride-unit-cell-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Cobalt%28II%29-fluoride-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Cobalt%28II%29-fluoride-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cobalt(II)_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Cobalt(II) fluoride","Other names":"cobalt difluoride","CAS Number":"10026-17-2 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23205 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.044","EC Number":"233-061-9","PubChem CID":"24820","RTECS number":"GG0770000","UNII":"9KI67810UR N","Chemical formula":"<a href=\"/wiki/Cobalt\" title=\"Cobalt\">Co</a><a href=\"/wiki/Fluorine\" title=\"Fluorine\">F<sub>2</sub></a>","Molar mass":"96.93 g/mol","Appearance":"Red crystalline solid","Density":"4.46 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.22 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahydrate)","Melting point":"1,217 °C (2,223 °F; 1,490 K)","Boiling point":"1,400 °C (2,550 °F; 1,670 K)","Solubility in water":"1.4 g/100 mL (25 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in HF\ninsoluble in alcohol, ether, benzene","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+9490.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"tetragonal (a,hydrous)\northorhombic (tetrahydrate)","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"oral (rat): 150 mg/kg","Other anions":"cobalt(II) oxide, cobalt(II) chloride","Other cations":"iron(II) fluoride, nickel(II) fluoride","Related compounds":"cobalt trifluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
