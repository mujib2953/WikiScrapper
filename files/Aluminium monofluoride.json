{"name":"Aluminium monofluoride","desc":"Aluminium monofluoride is the chemical compound with the formula AlF. This elusive species is formed by the reaction between aluminium trifluoride and metallic aluminium at elevated temperatures but quickly reverts to the reactants when cooled. Clusters derived from related aluminium(I) halides can be stabilized using specialized ligands.","images":[{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_monofluoride","IUPAC name":"Aluminium monofluoride","CAS Number":"13595-82-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:49464 Y","ChemSpider":"4576555 N","PubChem CID":"5464153","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Aluminium\">Al</span><span title=\"Fluorine\">F</span>","Molar mass":"45.98 g/mol","Other anions":"aluminium monochloride","Other cations":"lithium fluoride, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
