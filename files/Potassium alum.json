{"name":"Potassium alum","desc":"Potassium alum, potash alum, or potassium aluminum sulfate is a chemical compound: the potassium double sulfate of aluminium. Its chemical formula is KAl(SO4)2 and it is commonly found in its dodecahydrate form as KAl(SO4)2·12H2O. Alum is the common name for this chemical compound, given the nomenclature of potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate. It is commonly used in water purification, leather tanning, dyeing, fireproof textiles, and baking powder. It also has cosmetic uses as a deodorant, as an aftershave treatment and as a styptic for minor bleeding from shaving.","images":[{"alt":"Aluminium potassium sulfate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Potassium_alum.jpg/250px-Potassium_alum.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_alum","IUPAC name[2][3]":"Aluminium potassium sulfate dodecahydrate[2][3]","[1]":"Potassium alum\nPotash alum\nAlum-(K)[1]\nphitkari","CAS Number":"10043-67-1 Y\n7784-24-9 (dodecahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:86463 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.116","E number":"E522 (acidity regulators, ...)","PubChem CID":"24856","UNII":"09OXB01F3O N","Chemical formula":"KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#xB7;12H<sub>2</sub>O","Molar mass":"474.3884 g/mol","Appearance":"white small crystals","Odor":"watery metallic","Density":"1.725 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"92 to 95 °C (198 to 203 °F; 365 to 368 K)","Boiling point":"200 °C (392 °F; 473 K)","Solubility in water":"14.00 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n36.80 g/100 mL (50 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in acetone","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4564","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
