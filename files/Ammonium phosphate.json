{"name":"Ammonium phosphate","desc":"Ammonium phosphate is the salt of ammonium and phosphate. It is a highly unstable compound with the formula (NH4)3PO4. Because of its instability, it is elusive and of no commercial value (except for scientific research). In addition to (NH4)3PO4, a related double salt (NH4)2HPO4 is also recognized. It too is unstable. The instability of these salts results in their facile decomposition with evolution of ammonia:","images":[{"alt":"Ammonium phosphate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Ammonium_phosphate.png/200px-Ammonium_phosphate.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of three ammonium cations and one phosphate anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Triammonium-phosphate-3D-balls.png/240px-Triammonium-phosphate-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_phosphate","IUPAC name":"ammonium phosphate","Other names":"triammonium phosphate","CAS Number":"10361-65-6  Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"140090 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.709","UNII":"2ZJF06M0I9 N","Chemical formula":"(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"149g","Appearance":"White, tetrahedral crystals","Solubility in water":"58.0 g/100 mL (25 °C)","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1671.9 kJ/mol","Other cations":"Trisodium phosphate\nTripotassium phosphate","Related compounds":"Diammonium phosphate\nMonoammonium phosphate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
