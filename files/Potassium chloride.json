{"name":"Potassium chloride","desc":"Potassium chloride (KCl) is a metal halide salt composed of potassium and chloride. It is odorless and has a white or colorless vitreous crystal appearance. The solid dissolves readily in water and its solutions have a salt-like taste. KCl is used as a fertilizer, in medicine, scientific applications, food processing, and used to cause cardiac arrest as the third drug in the \"three drug cocktail\" for executions by lethal injection. It occurs naturally as the mineral sylvite and in combination with sodium chloride as sylvinite.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium chloride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Potassium_chloride.jpg/200px-Potassium_chloride.jpg"},{"alt":"Potassium-chloride-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Potassium-chloride-3D-ionic.png/200px-Potassium-chloride-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_chloride","Sylvite":"Sylvite\nMuriate of potash","CAS Number":"7447-40-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:32588 Y","ChemSpider":"4707 Y","DrugBank":"DB00761 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.374","E number":"E508 (acidity regulators, ...)","KEGG":"D02060 Y","PubChem CID":"4873","RTECS number":"TS8050000","UNII":"660YQ98I10 Y","Chemical formula":"KCl","Molar mass":"74.5513 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white crystalline solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.984 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"770 °C (1,420 °F; 1,040 K)","Boiling point":"1,420 °C (2,590 °F; 1,690 K)","Solubility in water":"21.74% (0 °C)\n25.39% (20 °C)\n36.05% (100 °C)","Solubility":"Soluble in glycerol, alkalies\nSlightly soluble in alcohol Insoluble in ether[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"~7","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−39.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4902 (589 nm)","Crystal structure":"face centered cubic","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Lattice constant":"a = 629.2 pm [2]","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (K+)\nOctahedral (Cl−)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"83 J·mol−1·K−1[3]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−436 kJ·mol−1[3]","ATC code":"A12BA01 (WHO) B05XA01 (WHO)","Pregnancy\ncategory":"US: C (Risk not ruled out)","Routes of\nadministration":"Oral, IV, IM","Pharmacokinetics":"","Excretion":"Renal: 90%; Fecal: 10% [4]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1450","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2600 mg/kg (oral, rat)[5]","Other anions":"Potassium fluoride\nPotassium bromide\nPotassium iodide\nPotassium astatide","Other cations":"Lithium chloride\nSodium chloride\nRubidium chloride\nCaesium chloride\nFrancium chloride","Related compounds":"Potassium chlorate\nPotassium perchlorate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
