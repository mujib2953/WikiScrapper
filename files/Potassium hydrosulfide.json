{"name":"Potassium hydrosulfide","desc":"Potassium hydrosulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula KHS. This colourless salt consists of the cation K+ and the bisulfide anion [SH]−. It is the product of the half-neutralization of hydrogen sulfide with potassium hydroxide. The compound is used in the synthesis of some organosulfur compounds. It is prepared by neutralizing aqueous KOH with H2S. Aqueous solutions of potassium sulfide consist of a mixture of potassium hydrosulfide and potassium hydroxide.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium-hydrosulfide-LT-xtal-1991-CM-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Sodium-hydrosulfide-LT-xtal-1991-CM-3D-balls.png/250px-Sodium-hydrosulfide-LT-xtal-1991-CM-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_hydrosulfide","IUPAC name":"Potassium hydrosulfide","Other names":"Potassium bisulfide, Potassium sulfhydrate, potassium hydrogen sulfide","CAS Number":"1310-61-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"92246 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.803","EC Number":"215-182-9","PubChem CID":"102109","Chemical formula":"KHS<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Molar mass":"72.171 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"1.68&#x2013;1.70 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"455 °C (851 °F; 728 K)","Solubility in water":"good","Main hazards":"Flammable solid, stench, releases hydrogen sulfide","NFPA 704":"2\n3\n0","Other anions":"Potassium hydroxide","Other cations":"Sodium hydrosulfide","Related compounds":"potassium sulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
