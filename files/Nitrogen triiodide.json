{"name":"Nitrogen triiodide","desc":"Nitrogen triiodide is the inorganic compound with the formula NI3. It is an extremely sensitive contact explosive: small quantities explode with a loud, sharp snap when touched even lightly, releasing a purple cloud of iodine vapor; it can even be detonated by alpha radiation. NI3 has a complex structural chemistry that is difficult to study because of the instability of the derivatives.","images":[{"alt":"Nitrogen triiodide (structural formula)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Nitrogen-iodide-2D.png/120px-Nitrogen-iodide-2D.png"},{"alt":"Nitrogen triiodide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Nitrogen-triiodide-3D-balls.png/100px-Nitrogen-triiodide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nitrogen_triiodide","":"","IUPAC name":"Triiodoamine","Other names":"Nitrogen iodide\nAmmonia triiodide\nTriiodine nitride\nTriiodine mononitride\nTriiodamine","CAS Number":"13444-85-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"55511 Y","PubChem CID":"61603","Chemical formula":"NI<sub>3 </sub>","Molar mass":"394.719 g/mol","Appearance":"red solid","Boiling point":"sublimes at −20 °C","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Solubility":"organic solvents,[1] such as diethyl ether","Main hazards":"Extremely explosive","NFPA 704":"0\n0\n4","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
