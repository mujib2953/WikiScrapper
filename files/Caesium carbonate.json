{"name":"Caesium carbonate","desc":"Caesium carbonate or cesium carbonate is a white crystalline solid compound. Caesium carbonate has a high solubility in polar solvents such as water, alcohol and DMF. Its solubility is higher in organic solvents compared to other carbonates like potassium and sodium carbonates, although it remains quite insoluble in other organic solvents such as toluene, p-xylene, and chlorobenzene. This compound is used in organic synthesis as a base. It also appears to have applications in energy conversion.","images":[{"alt":"Cesiumcarbonaat.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Cesiumcarbonaat.png/200px-Cesiumcarbonaat.png"},{"alt":"Caesium-carbonate-3D-Balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Caesium-carbonate-3D-Balls.png/200px-Caesium-carbonate-3D-Balls.png"},{"alt":"Caesium carbonate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Caesium_carbonate.jpg/200px-Caesium_carbonate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Caesium_carbonate","IUPAC name":"Caesium carbonate","Other names":"Cesium carbonate","CAS Number":"534-17-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"10339 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.812","EC Number":"208-591-9","PubChem CID":"10796","Chemical formula":"Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"325.82 g/mol","Appearance":"white powder","Density":"4.072 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"610 °C (1,130 °F; 883 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"2605 g/L (15 °C)","Solubility in ethanol":"110 g/L","Solubility in Dimethylformamide":"119.6 g/L","Solubility in Dimethyl sulfoxide":"361.7 g/L","Solubility in Sulfolane":"394.2 g/L","Solubility in Methylpyrrolidone":"723.3 g/L","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-103.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Caesium bicarbonate","Other cations":"Lithium carbonate\nSodium carbonate\nPotassium carbonate\nRubidium carbonate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
