{"name":"Ammonium chromate","desc":"Ammonium chromate is a salt with the formula (NH4)2CrO4. It forms yellow, monoclinic crystals; made from ammonium hydroxide and ammonium dichromate; used in photography as a sensitizer for gelatin coatings. It's often used in photography, textile printing, and fixing chromate dyes on wool. It is also used as an analytical reagent, catalyst, and corrosion inhibitor. It is soluble in water, and, when applied, can cause irritation in the mucous membrane, eyes, respiratory tract, skin, etc. It may cause skin sensitization after prolonged contact. It is also known to be carcinogenic (cancer-causing), and it can cause tissue ulceration and injury to the liver and kidneys.","images":[{"alt":"Chroman amonný.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Chroman_amonn%C3%BD.JPG/200px-Chroman_amonn%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_chromate","Other names":"Ammonium chromate(IV)","CAS Number":"7788-98-9","ChemSpider":"22997","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.217","Chemical formula":"(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"152.07 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow crystals","Density":"1.90 g/ml","Melting point":"185 °C (365 °F; 458 K) decomposes[1]","Solubility in water":"24.8 g/100ml (0 °C)\n37.36 g/100ml (25 °C)[1]\n45.3 g/100ml (40 °C)\n70.06 g/100ml (75 °C)[1][2]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"657 J/K·mol","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-1163 kJ/mol","Main hazards":"Toxic","GHS pictograms":"[3]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H272, H314, H334, H350, H400[3]","GHS precautionary statements":"P201, P220, P261, P273, P280, P305+351+338[3]"}
