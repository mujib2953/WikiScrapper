{"name":"Methyl iodide","desc":"Methyl iodide, also called iodomethane, and commonly abbreviated \"MeI\", is the chemical compound with the formula CH3I. It is a dense, colorless, volatile liquid. In terms of chemical structure, it is related to methane by replacement of one hydrogen atom by an atom of iodine. It is naturally emitted by rice plantations in small amounts. It is also produced in vast quantities estimated to be greater than 214,000 tons annually by algae and kelp in the world's temperate oceans, and in lesser amounts on land by terrestrial fungi and bacteria. It is used in organic synthesis as a source of methyl groups.","images":[{"alt":"Stereo skeletal formula of methyl iodide with all explicit hydrogens added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Methyl_iodide.svg/100px-Methyl_iodide.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of methyl iodide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Iodomethane-3D-balls.png/100px-Iodomethane-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iodomethane","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Iodomethane[1]\nIodomethane[1]","[1]":"Methyl iodide[1]\nMethyl iodine\nMonoiodomethane\n\n\n\n\nMethyl iodide[1]\nMethyl iodine\nMonoiodomethane","CAS Number":"74-88-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Abbreviations":"Halon 10001\nMeI","Beilstein Reference":"969135","ChEBI":"CHEBI:39282 Y","ChemSpider":"6088 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.745","EC Number":"200-819-5","Gmelin Reference":"1233","KEGG":"C18448 Y","MeSH":"methyl+iodide","PubChem CID":"6328","RTECS number":"PA9450000","UN number":"2644","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Iodine\">I</span>","Molar mass":"141.94 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"pungent, ether-like[2]","Density":"2.28 g mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>","Melting point":"−66.5 °C; −87.6 °F; 206.7 K","Boiling point":"42.4 to 42.8 °C; 108.2 to 108.9 °F; 315.5 to 315.9 K","Solubility in water":"14 g L−1 (at 20 °C (68 °F))[3]","log P":"1.609","Vapor pressure":"54.4 kPa (at 20 °C (68 °F))","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"1.4 μmol Pa−1 kg−1","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-57.2·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.530–1.531","Molecular shape":"Tetrahedron","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"82.75 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−14.1–−13.1 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−808.9–−808.3 kJ mol−1","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H301, H312, H315, H331, H335, H351","GHS precautionary statements":"P261, P280, P301+310, P311","NFPA 704":"1\n3\n1","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"76 mg kg−1 (oral, rat)[3]\n800 mg kg−1 (dermal, guinea pig)","LC50 (median concentration)":"1550 ppm (rat, 30 min)\n860 ppm (mouse, 57 min)\n220 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[4]","LCLo (lowest published)":"3800 ppm (rat, 15 min)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5 ppm (28 mg/m3) [skin][2]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca TWA 2 ppm (10 mg/m3) [skin][2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [100 ppm][2]","Related iodomethanes":"Methane\nDiiodomethane\nIodoform\nCarbon tetraiodide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
