{"name":"Propyne","desc":"Propyne (methylacetylene) is an alkyne with the chemical formula CH3C≡CH. It was a component of MAPP gas—along with its isomer propadiene (allene), which was commonly used in gas welding. Unlike acetylene, propyne can be safely condensed.","images":[{"alt":"Methylacetylene","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Propyne.png/120px-Propyne.png"},{"alt":"Propyne3D.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Propyne3D.png/180px-Propyne3D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Propyne","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Prop-1-yne[1]\nProp-1-yne[1]","Other names":"Propyne\nMethylacetylene\nMethyl acetylene\nAllylene","CAS Number":"74-99-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"878138","ChEBI":"CHEBI:48086 Y","ChemSpider":"6095","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.754","EC Number":"200-828-4","MeSH":"C022030","PubChem CID":"6335","Chemical formula":"C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"40.0639 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless gas[2]","Odor":"Sweet[2]","Density":"0.53 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−102.7 °C (−152.9 °F; 170.5 K)","Boiling point":"−23.2 °C (−9.8 °F; 250.0 K)","Vapor pressure":"5.2 atm (20°C)[2]","Explosive limits":"1.7%-?[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1000 ppm (1650 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1000 ppm (1650 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1700 ppm[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
