{"name":"Barium metaphosphate","desc":"Barium metaphosphate is an inorganic substance with the molecular formula Ba(PO3)2. It is a colourless solid that is insoluble in water. X-ray crystallography shows that this material is composed of Ba2+ cations attached to a polyphosphate ((PO3−)n) anion. A number of hydrated forms are known which are actually cyclic metaphosphates, Ba2(P4O12)·3.5H2O, Ba3(P3O9)2·6H2O.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Barium_metaphosphate","IUPAC name":"barium(2+); dioxido(oxo)phosphanium","CAS Number":"13762-83-9","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.951","PubChem CID":"3084168","Chemical formula":"Ba(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"295.27 g/mol","Appearance":"Powder[1]","Density":"3.63 g/cm<sup>3</sup>"}
