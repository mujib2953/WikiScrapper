{"name":"Chromium(IV) oxide","desc":"Chromium dioxide or chromium(IV) oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO2. It is a black synthetic magnetic solid. It once was widely used in magnetic tape emulsion. With the increasing popularity of CDs and DVDs, the use of chromium(IV) oxide has declined. However, it is still used in data tape applications for enterprise-class storage systems. It is still considered by many oxide and tape manufacturers to have been one of the best magnetic recording particulates ever invented.","images":[{"alt":"Chromium(IV) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(IV)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Chromium(IV) oxide, Chromium dioxide","Other names":"Crolyn\nmagtrieve","CAS Number":"12018-01-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:48263 Y","ChemSpider":"21171202 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.470","PubChem CID":"176261494","RTECS number":"GB6400000","Chemical formula":"CrO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"83.9949 g/mol","Appearance":"black tetrahedral ferromagnetic crystals","Density":"4.89 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"375 °C (707 °F; 648 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Crystal structure":"Rutile (tetragonal), tP6","Space group":"P42/mnm, No. 136","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1310","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"250 mg/m3[2]","Other cations":"Vanadium(IV) oxide\nManganese(IV) oxide","Related":"Chromium(II) oxide\nChromium(II,III) oxide\nChromium(III) oxide\nChromium trioxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
