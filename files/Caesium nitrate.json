{"name":"Caesium nitrate","desc":"Caesium nitrate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CsNO3. An alkali metal nitrate, it is used in pyrotechnic compositions, as a colorant and an oxidizer, e.g. in decoys and illumination flares. The caesium emissions are chiefly due to two powerful spectral lines at 852.113 nm and 894.347 nm.","images":[{"alt":"Cesium nitrate.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Cesium_nitrate.JPG/200px-Cesium_nitrate.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Caesium_nitrate","CAS Number":"7789-18-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56425 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.224","EC Number":"232-146-8","UN number":"1451","Chemical formula":"CsNO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"194.91 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"3.685 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"414 °C (777 °F; 687 K)","Boiling point":"decomposes, see text","Solubility in water":"9.16 g/100 ml (0 °C)\n196.8 g/100 ml (100 °C)","Solubility in acetone":"soluble","Solubility in ethanol":"slightly soluble","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"WARNING","GHS hazard statements":"H272","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P220, P221, P280, P370+378, P501","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2390 mg/kg (oral, rat)[2]","Other anions":"Caesium nitrite","Other cations":"Lithium nitrate\nSodium nitrate\nPotassium nitrate\nRubidium nitrate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
