{"name":"Uranium trioxide","desc":"Uranium trioxide (UO3), also called uranyl oxide, uranium(VI) oxide, and uranic oxide, is the hexavalent oxide of uranium. The solid may be obtained by heating uranyl nitrate to 400 °C. Its most commonly encountered polymorph, γ-UO3, is a yellow-orange powder.","images":[{"alt":"UO3 gamma lattice.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/UO3_gamma_lattice.png/200px-UO3_gamma_lattice.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Uranium_trioxide","IUPAC names":"Uranium trioxide\nUranium(VI) oxide","Other names":"Uranyl oxide\nUranic oxide","CAS Number":"1344-58-7 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.014.274","Chemical formula":"UO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"286.29 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow-orange powder","Density":"5.5&#x2013;8.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"~200–650 °C (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"Partially soluble","Crystal structure":"see text","Space group":"I41/amd (γ-UO3)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"99 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1230 kJ·mol−1[1]","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Very toxic (T+)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R26/28, R33, R51/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S20/21, S45, S61","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Related uranium oxides":"Uranium dioxide\nTriuranium octoxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
