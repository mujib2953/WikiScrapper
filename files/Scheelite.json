{"name":"Scheelite","desc":"Scheelite is a calcium tungstate mineral with the chemical formula CaWO4. It is an important ore of tungsten (wolfram). Well-formed crystals are sought by collectors and are occasionally fashioned into gemstones when suitably free of flaws. Scheelite has been synthesized via the Czochralski process; the material produced may be used to imitate diamond, as a scintillator, or as a solid-state lasing medium. It was also used in radium paint in the same fashion as was zinc sulphide, and Thomas Edison invented a fluoroscope with a calcium tungstate-coated screen, making the images six times brighter that those with barium platinocyanide; the latter chemical allowed RÃ¶ntgen to discover X-rays in early November 1895.","images":[{"alt":"Scheelite-224167.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Scheelite-224167.jpg/260px-Scheelite-224167.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_tungstate"}
