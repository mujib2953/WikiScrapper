{"name":"4-Hydroxybenzoic acid","desc":"4-Hydroxybenzoic acid, also known as p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), is a monohydroxybenzoic acid, a phenolic derivative of benzoic acid. It is a white crystalline solid that is slightly soluble in water and chloroform but more soluble in polar organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid is primarily known as the basis for the preparation of its esters, known as parabens, which are used as preservatives in cosmetics and some ophthalmic solutions. It is isomeric with 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, known as salicylic acid, a precursor to aspirin.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/4-Hydroxybenzoic_acid.svg/100px-4-Hydroxybenzoic_acid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/4-hydroxybenzoic_acid","":"","IUPAC name":"4-Hydroxybenzoic acid","Other names":"p-Hydroxybenzoic acid\npara-Hydroxybenzoic acid\nPHBA\n4-hydroxybenzoate","CAS Number":"99-96-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30763 Y","ChemSpider":"132 Y","DrugBank":"DB04242 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.002.550","EC Number":"202-804-9","KEGG":"C00156 Y","PubChem CID":"135","Chemical formula":"C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"138.121 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystalline","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.46 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"214.5 °C (418.1 °F; 487.6 K)","Boiling point":"n/a\ndecomposes[1]","Solubility in water":"0.5 g/100 mL","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ether, acetone\nslightly soluble in chloroform\nnegligible in CS2","log P":"1.58","Acidity (pKa)":"4.54","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"HMDB","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Autoignition\ntemperature":"250 °C (482 °F; 523 K)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2200 mg/kg (oral, mouse)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
