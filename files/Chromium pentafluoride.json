{"name":"Chromium pentafluoride","desc":"Chromium pentafluoride is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula CrF5. It is a red volatile solid that melts at 30 °C, which easily hydrolyses to chromium(III) and chromium(VI). It has the same crystal structure as vanadium pentafluoride. It is the highest known chromium fluoride, since the hypothetical chromium hexafluoride has not yet been synthesized.","images":[{"alt":"CrF5cain.tif","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/CrF5cain.tif/lossless-page1-464px-CrF5cain.tif.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(V)_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Chromium(V) fluoride","Other names":"Chromium fluoride, Chromium(V) fluoride, Pentafluorochromium, Pentafluoridochromium","CAS Number":"14884-42-5","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"4574207","PubChem CID":"5460742","Chemical formula":"CrF<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"291.71 g/mol","Appearance":"red crystals[1]","Density":"2.89 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"34 °C (93 °F; 307 K)[1]","Boiling point":"117 °C (243 °F; 390 K)[1]","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic[1]"}
