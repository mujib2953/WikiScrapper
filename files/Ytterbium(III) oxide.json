{"name":"Ytterbium(III) oxide","desc":"Ytterbium(III) oxide is the chemical compound with the formula Yb2O3. It is one of the more commonly encountered compounds of ytterbium. It has the \"rare-earth C-type sesquioxide\" structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed, leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate (non-octahedral) environments.","images":[{"alt":"Ytterbium(III) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Ytterbium%28III%29_oxide.jpg/200px-Ytterbium%28III%29_oxide.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Ytterbium(III)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Ytterbium(III) oxide.","Other names":"Ytterbia\ndiytterbium trioxide\nytterbium sesquioxide","CAS Number":"1314-37-0 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.850","Chemical formula":"Yb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"394.08 g/mol","Appearance":"White solid.","Density":"9.17 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid.","Melting point":"2,355 °C (4,271 °F; 2,628 K)","Boiling point":"4,070 °C (7,360 °F; 4,340 K)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Crystal structure":"Cubic","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"133.05 J/mol·K [1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-181.4600 kJ/mol [1]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-172.6844 kJ/mol [1]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"None listed.","R-phrases (outdated)":"None listed.","S-phrases (outdated)":"None listed.","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable.","Other anions":"Ytterbium(III) sulfide, Ytterbium(III) chloride","Other cations":"Thulium(III) oxide\nLutetium(III) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
