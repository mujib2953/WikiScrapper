{"name":"Dimethylsulfoniopropionate","desc":"Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2S+CH2CH2COO−. This zwitterionic metabolite can be found in marine phytoplankton, seaweeds, and some species of terrestrial and aquatic vascular plants. It functions as an osmolyte as well as several other physiological and environmental roles have also been identified. DMSP was first identified in the marine red alga Polysiphonia fastigiata by Frederick Challenger and Margaret Simpson (later Dr. Whitaker) ","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of dimethylsulfoniopropionate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Dimethylsulfoniopropionate_Structural_Formula_V1.svg/170px-Dimethylsulfoniopropionate_Structural_Formula_V1.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the dimethylsulfoniopropionate zwitterion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Dimethylsulfoniopropionate_zwitterion_3D_ball.png/170px-Dimethylsulfoniopropionate_zwitterion_3D_ball.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Dimethylsulfoniopropionate","IUPAC name":"(Dimethylsulfaniumyl)propanoate","Other names":"dimethyl-β-propiothetin","CAS Number":"7314-30-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22195 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.228.826","PubChem CID":"23736","Chemical formula":"C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S","Molar mass":"134.1967","Appearance":"white crystalline hygroscopic powder with a characteristic odor.[1]","Melting point":"120 to 125 °C (248 to 257 °F; 393 to 398 K)[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
