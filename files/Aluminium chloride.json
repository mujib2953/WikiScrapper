{"name":"Aluminium chloride","desc":"Aluminium chloride (AlCl3) is the main compound of aluminium and chlorine. It is white, but samples are often contaminated with iron(III) chloride, giving it a yellow color. The solid has a low melting and boiling point. It is mainly produced and consumed in the production of aluminium metal, but large amounts are also used in other areas of chemical industry. The compound is often cited as a Lewis acid. It is an example of an inorganic compound that \"cracks\" at mild temperature, reversibly changing from a polymer to a monomer.","images":[{"alt":"Aluminium chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Aluminium-trichloride-hexahydrate-white-and-yellow.jpg/200px-Aluminium-trichloride-hexahydrate-white-and-yellow.jpg"},{"alt":"Aluminium trichloride dimer","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Aluminium-trichloride-dimer-3D-balls.png/200px-Aluminium-trichloride-dimer-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_trichloride","IUPAC name":"aluminium chloride","Other names":"aluminium(III) chloride\naluminum trichloride","CAS Number":"7446-70-0 (anhydrous) Y\n10124-27-3 (hydrate) N\n7784-13-6 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30114 Y","ChemSpider":"22445 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.371","Gmelin Reference":"1876","PubChem CID":"24012","RTECS number":"BD0530000","UNII":"LIF1N9568Y Y","Chemical formula":"AlCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"133.341 g/mol (anhydrous)\n241.432 g/mol (hexahydrate)[1]","Appearance":"white or pale yellow solid,\nhygroscopic","Density":"2.48 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.398 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"192.6 °C (378.7 °F; 465.8 K)\n(anhydrous)[1]\n100 °C (212 °F; 373 K)\n(hexahydrate, dec.)[1]","Boiling point":"180 °C (356 °F; 453 K) (sublimates)[1]","Solubility in water":"439 g/l (0 °C)\n449 g/l (10 °C)\n458 g/l (20 °C)\n466 g/l (30 °C)\n473 g/l (40 °C)\n481 g/l (60 °C)\n486 g/l (80 °C)\n490 g/l (100 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in hydrogen chloride, ethanol, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride\nslightly soluble in benzene","Vapor pressure":"133.3 Pa (99 °C)\n13.3 kPa (151 °C)[2]","Viscosity":"0.35 cP (197 °C)\n0.26 cP (237 °C)[2]","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic, mS16","Space group":"C12/m1, No. 12[3]","Lattice constant":"a = 0.591 nm, b = 0.591 nm, c = 1.752 nm[3]","Lattice volume (V)":"0.52996 nm3","Formula units (Z)":"6","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (solid)\nTetrahedral (liquid)","Molecular shape":"Trigonal planar\n(monomeric vapour)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"91.1 J/mol·K[4]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"109.3 J/mol·K[4]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−704.2 kJ/mol[4]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-628.8 kJ/mol[4]","ATC code":"D10AX01 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","GHS pictograms":"[5]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H314[5]","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P310, P305+351+338[5]","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"anhydrous:\n380 mg/kg, rat (oral)\n\nhexahydrate:\n3311 mg/kg, rat (oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[6]","REL (Recommended)":"2 mg/m3[6]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[6]","Other anions":"Aluminium fluoride\nAluminium bromide\nAluminium iodide","Other cations":"Boron trichloride\nGallium trichloride\nIndium(III) chloride\nMagnesium chloride","Related Lewis acids":"Iron(III) chloride\nBoron trifluoride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
