{"name":"Rhenium heptafluoride","desc":"Rhenium heptafluoride is the compound with the formula ReF7. It is a yellow low melting solid, and is the only thermally stable metal heptafluoride. It has a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal structure similar to IF7, which was confirmed by neutron diffraction at 1.5K. The structure is non-rigid as evidenced by electron diffraction studies.","images":[{"alt":"ReF7 structure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/ReF7_structure.png/200px-ReF7_structure.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Rhenium_heptafluoride","IUPAC name":"rhenium heptafluoride, heptafluoridorhenium","CAS Number":"17029-21-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"26323924 N","PubChem CID":"123369","Chemical formula":"ReF<sub>7</sub>","Molar mass":"319.196 g/mol","Appearance":"Bright yellow crystalline solid","Density":"4.3g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"48.3 °C (118.9 °F; 321.4 K)","Boiling point":"73.72 °C (164.70 °F; 346.87 K)","Crystal structure":"triclinic, aP16","Space group":"P-1, No. 2","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
