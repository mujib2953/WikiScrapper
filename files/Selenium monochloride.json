{"name":"Selenium monochloride","desc":"Selenium monochloride is an inorganic compound with the formula Se2Cl2. Although it is called selenium monochloride, a more descriptive name might be diselenium dichloride. It is a reddish-brown, oily liquid that hydrolyses slowly. It exists in chemical equilibrium with SeCl2, SeCl4, chlorine, and elemental selenium. Selenium monochloride is mainly used as a reagent for the synthesis of Se-containing compounds.","images":[{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Selenium(I)_chloride","IUPAC name":"Selenium monochloride","Other names":"Dichlorodiselenide, Diselenium dichloride, Selenium chloride, 1,2-dichlorodiselane","CAS Number":"10025-68-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"59591 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.022","PubChem CID":"66206","UNII":"2A5292FC4P N","Chemical formula":"Se<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"228.83 g/mol","Appearance":"Reddish-brown oily liquid","Density":"2.7741 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−85 °C (−121 °F; 188 K)","Boiling point":"127 °C (261 °F; 400 K) at 0.997 atm","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility in other solvents":"Soluble in chloroform, carbon disulfide, and acetonitrile","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−94.8·10−6 cm3/mol","R-phrases (outdated)":"R23/24/25-R34","S-phrases (outdated)":"S22-S26-S36/37/39-S45","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
