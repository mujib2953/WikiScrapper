{"name":"Silver chromate","desc":"Silver chromate (Ag2CrO4) is a brown-red monoclinic crystal and is a chemical precursor to modern photography. It can be formed by combining silver nitrate (AgNO3) and potassium chromate (K2CrO4) or sodium chromate (Na2CrO4). This reaction has been important in neuroscience, as it is used in the \"Golgi method\" of staining neurons for microscopy: the silver chromate produced precipitates inside neurons and makes their morphology visible.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Silver_chromate","CAS Number":"7784-01-2 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56417 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.130","PubChem CID":"62666","UNII":"ZJ5092LWU9 N","Chemical formula":"Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"331.73 g/mol","Appearance":"brown-red powder","Density":"5.625 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Boiling point":"1,550 °C (2,820 °F; 1,820 K)","Solubility":"soluble in nitric acid, ammonia, alkali cyanides and chromates [1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−40.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"142 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"217 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−712 kJ·mol−1[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
