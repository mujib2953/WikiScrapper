{"name":"Tripotassium phosphate","desc":"Potassium phosphate is a water-soluble ionic salt which has the chemical formula K3PO4. It is used as a food additive for its properties as an emulsifier, foaming agent, and whipping agent. In combination with fatty acids, it is a potential antimicrobial agent in poultry processing. As a fertilizer, its proportions of N, P2O5, and K2O are 0-33-67.","images":[{"alt":"Tripotassium phosphate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Tripotassium_phosphate.png/150px-Tripotassium_phosphate.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tripotassium_phosphate","IUPAC name":"Potassium phosphate","Systematic IUPAC name":"Potassium tetraoxidophosphate(3−)\nPotassium tetraoxidophosphate(3−)","Other names":"Potassium phosphate, tribasic","CAS Number":"7778-53-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56408 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.006","PubChem CID":"62657","Chemical formula":"K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"212.27 g/mol","Appearance":"White deliquescent powder","Density":"2.564 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (17 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"1,380 °C (2,520 °F; 1,650 K)","Solubility in water":"90 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Solubility in ethanol":"Insoluble","Basicity (pKb)":"1.6","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36-R38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26-S36","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other cations":"Trisodium phosphate\nTriammonium phosphate\nTricalcium phosphate","Related compounds":"Monopotassium phosphate\nDipotassium phosphate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
