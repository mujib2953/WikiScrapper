{"name":"Phosphoric acid","desc":"Phosphoric acid (also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric(V) acid) is a mineral (inorganic) acid having the chemical formula H3PO4. Orthophosphoric acid refers to phosphoric acid, which is the IUPAC name for this compound. The prefix ortho- is used to distinguish the acid from related phosphoric acids, called polyphosphoric acids. Orthophosphoric acid is a non-toxic acid, which, when pure, is a solid at room temperature and pressure. The conjugate base of phosphoric acid is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H\n2PO−\n4, which in turn has a conjugate base of hydrogen phosphate, HPO2−\n4, which has a conjugate base of phosphate, PO3−\n4. Phosphates are essential for life.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of phosphoric acid, showing dimensions","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Phosphoric-acid-2D-dimensions.png/150px-Phosphoric-acid-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Phosphoric-acid-3D-balls.png/120px-Phosphoric-acid-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Phosphoric_acid","":"","IUPAC name":"Phosphoric acid; trihydroxidooxidophosphorus","Other names":"Orthophosphoric acid; Trihydroxylphosphine oxide","CAS Number":"7664-38-2 Y\n16271-20-8 />16271-20-8 (hemihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:26078 Y","ChemSpider":"979 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.758","EC Number":"231-633-2","E number":"E338 (antioxidants, ...)","KEGG":"D05467 Y","PubChem CID":"1004","RTECS number":"TB6300000","UNII":"E4GA8884NN Y","UN number":"1805","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Phosphorus\">P</span>","Molar mass":"97.99 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white solid or colourless, viscous liquid (>42 °C)\ndeliquescent","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.885 g/mL (liquid)<br>\n1.685 g/mL (85% solution)<br>\n2.030 g/mL (crystal at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"42.35 °C (108.23 °F; 315.50 K)\n(anhydrous)\n29.32 °C (84.78 °F; 302.47 K)\n(hemihydrate)","Boiling point":"158 °C (316 °F; 431 K)\n213 °C (415 °F; 486 K)\ndecomposes","Solubility in water":"392.2 g/100 g (−16.3 °C)\n369.4 g/100 mL (0.5 °C)\n446 g/100 mL (14.95 °C)\nmiscible (42.3 °C)[1]","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol","Vapor pressure":"0.03 mmHg (20°C)[2]","Acidity (pKa)":"pKa1 = 2.148\npKa2 = 7.198\npKa3 = 12.319","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−43.8·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3420 (8.8% w/w aq. soln)[3]\n1.4320 (85% aq. soln) 25 °C","Viscosity":"2.4–9.4 cP (85% aq. soln.)\n147 cP (100%)","Crystal structure":"monoclinic","Molecular shape":"pseudo-tetrahedral","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"158 J/(mol·K)[4]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1288 kJ/mol[4]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1008","GHS pictograms":"[5]","GHS signal word":"Corrosive","GHS hazard statements":"H290, H314[5]","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P305+351+338, P310[5]","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1530 mg/kg (rat, oral)[6]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 ST 3 mg/m3[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1000 mg/m3[2]","Related phosphorus oxoacids":"Hypophosphorous acid\nPhosphorous acid\nPyrophosphoric acid\nTriphosphoric acid\nPerphosphoric acid\nPermonophosphoric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
