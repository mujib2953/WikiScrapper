{"name":"n-Butyllithium","desc":"n-Butyllithium (abbreviated n-BuLi) is an organolithium reagent. It is widely used as a polymerization initiator in the production of elastomers such as polybutadiene or styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS). Also, it is broadly employed as a strong base (superbase) in the synthesis of organic compounds as in the pharmaceutical industry.","images":[{"alt":"N-butyllithium-tetramer-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/N-butyllithium-tetramer-3D-balls.png/100px-N-butyllithium-tetramer-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Butyllithium-hexamer-from-xtal-3D-balls-C.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Butyllithium-hexamer-from-xtal-3D-balls-C.png/200px-Butyllithium-hexamer-from-xtal-3D-balls-C.png"}],"link":"/wiki/N-butyllithium","n-Butyllithium tetramer":"n-Butyllithium hexamer","IUPAC name":"butyllithium, tetra-μ3-butyl-tetralithium","Other names":"NBL, BuLi,\n1-lithiobutane","CAS Number":"109-72-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:51469 Y","ChemSpider":"10254339 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.363","PubChem CID":"61028","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Lithium\">Li</span>","Molar mass":"64.06 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless liquid\nunstable\nusually obtained\nas solution","Density":"0.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solvent defined","Melting point":"−76 °C (−105 °F; 197 K) (<273 K)","Boiling point":"decomposes","Solubility in water":"Reaction","Solubility":"Diethyl ether, cyclohexane","Acidity (pKa)":"50[citation needed][1]","Molecular shape":"tetrameric in solution","Dipole moment":"0 D","Main hazards":"pyrophoric (inflames in air),\ndecomposes to corrosive LiOH","NFPA 704":"4\n3\n3\nW","Related organolithium\nreagents":"sec-butyllithium\ntert-butyllithium\nhexyllithium\nmethyllithium","Related compounds":"lithium hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
