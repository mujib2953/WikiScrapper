{"name":"Potassium perchlorate","desc":"Potassium perchlorate is the inorganic salt with the chemical formula KClO4. Like other perchlorates, this salt is a strong oxidizer although it usually reacts very slowly with organic substances. This usually obtained as a colorless, crystalline solid is a common oxidizer used in fireworks, ammunition percussion caps, explosive primers, and is used variously in propellants, flash compositions, stars, and sparklers. It has been used as a solid rocket propellant, although in that application it has mostly been replaced by the higher performance ammonium perchlorate. KClO4 has the lowest solubility of the alkali metal perchlorates (1.5 g in 100 mL of water at 25 °C).","images":[{"alt":"Potassium perchlorate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Potassium_perchlorate.png/100px-Potassium_perchlorate.png"},{"alt":"Potassium-perchlorate-unit-cell-3D-balls-perspective.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Potassium-perchlorate-unit-cell-3D-balls-perspective.png/100px-Potassium-perchlorate-unit-cell-3D-balls-perspective.png"},{"alt":"Potassium perchlorate 200g.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Potassium_perchlorate_200g.jpg/200px-Potassium_perchlorate_200g.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_perchlorate","":"","Other names":"Potassium chlorate(VII); Perchloric acid, potassium salt; peroidin","CAS Number":"7778-74-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22913 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.011","EC Number":"231-912-9","PubChem CID":"516900","RTECS number":"SC9700000","UNII":"42255P5X4D Y","UN number":"1489","Chemical formula":"KClO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"138.55 g/mol","Appearance":"colourless/ white crystalline powder","Density":"2.5239 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"610 °C (1,130 °F; 883 K)\ndecomposes from 400 °C[4][5]","Solubility in water":"0.76 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n1.5 g/100 mL (25 °C)[1]\n4.76 g/100 mL (40 °C)\n21.08 g/100 mL (100 °C)[2]","Solubility product (Ksp)":"1.05·10−2[3]","Solubility":"negligible in alcohol\ninsoluble in ether","Solubility in ethanol":"47 mg/kg (0 °C)\n120 mg/kg (25 °C)[2]","Solubility in acetone":"1.6 g/kg[2]","Solubility in ethyl acetate":"15 mg/kg[2]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4724","Crystal structure":"Rhombohedral","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"111.35 J/mol·K[6]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"150.86 J/mol·K[6]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-433 kJ/mol[7]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-300.4 kJ/mol[2]","Safety data sheet":"MSDS","GHS pictograms":"[5]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H271, H302[5]","GHS precautionary statements":"P220[5]","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n1\nOX","Other anions":"Potassium chloride\nPotassium chlorate\nPotassium periodate","Other cations":"Ammonium perchlorate\nSodium perchlorate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
