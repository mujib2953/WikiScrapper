{"name":"Cadmium chloride","desc":"Cadmium chloride is a white crystalline compound of cadmium and chlorine, with the formula CdCl2. It is a hygroscopic solid that is highly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. Although it is considered to be ionic, it has considerable covalent character to its bonding. The crystal structure of cadmium chloride (described below), composed of two-dimensional layers of ions, is a reference for describing other crystal structures. Also known are CdCl2•H2O and CdCl2•5H2O.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of cadmium chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Cadmium-chloride-3D-balls.png/120px-Cadmium-chloride-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Cadmium chloride hemipentahydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Cadmium_chloride_hemipentahydrate.jpg/200px-Cadmium_chloride_hemipentahydrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_chloride","":"","IUPAC name":"Cadmium dichloride","Other names":"Cadmium(II) chloride","CAS Number":"10108-64-2 Y\n34330-64-8 (monohydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:35456 Y","ChemSpider":"23035 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.256","EC Number":"233-296-7","PubChem CID":"24947","RTECS number":"EV0175000","UNII":"J6K4F9V3BA Y","UN number":"2570","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Cadmium\">Cd</span><span title=\"Chlorine\">Cl</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"183.31 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White solid, hygroscopic","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"4.047 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<sup id=\"cite_ref-chemister_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-chemister-1\">[1]</a></sup><br>\n3.327 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (Hemipentahydrate)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"568 °C (1,054 °F; 841 K)\nat 760 mmHg[2]","Boiling point":"964 °C (1,767 °F; 1,237 K)\nat 760 mmHg[2]","Solubility in water":"Hemipentahydrate:\n79.5 g/100 mL (−10 °C)\n90 g/100 mL (0 °C)\nMonohydrate:\n119.6 g/100 mL (25 °C)[2]\n134.3 g/100 mL (40 °C)\n134.2 g/100 mL (60 °C)\n147 g/100 mL (100 °C)[3]","Solubility":"Soluble in alcohol, selenium(IV) oxychloride, benzonitrile\nInsoluble in ether, acetone[1]","Solubility in pyridine":"4.6 g/kg (0 °C)\n7.9 g/kg (4 °C)\n8.1 g/kg (15 °C)\n6.7 g/kg (30 °C)\n5 g/kg (100 °C)[1]","Solubility in ethanol":"1.3 g/100 g (10 °C)\n1.48 g/100 g (20 °C)\n1.91 g/100 g (40 °C)\n2.53 g/100 g (70 °C)[1]","Solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide":"18 g/100 g (25 °C)[1]","Vapor pressure":"0.01 kPa (471 °C)\n0.1 kPa (541 °C)[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−6.87·10−5 cm3/mol[2]","Viscosity":"2.31 cP (597 °C)\n1.87 cP (687 °C)[1]","Crystal structure":"Rhombohedral, hR9 (anhydrous)[4]\nMonoclinic (hemipentahydrate)[3]","Space group":"R3m, No. 166 (anhydrous)[4]","Point group":"3 2/m (anhydrous)[4]","Lattice constant":"a = 3.846 Å, c = 17.479 Å (anhydrous)[4]\nα = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 120°","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"74.7 J/mol·K[2]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"115.3 J/mol·K[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−391.5 kJ/mol[2]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"−343.9 kJ/mol[2]","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","GHS pictograms":"[5]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H301, H330, H340, H350, H360, H372, H410[5]","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P260, P273, P284, P301+310, P310[5]","NFPA 704":"1\n3\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"94 mg/kg (rats, oral)[1]\n60 mg/kg (mouse, oral)\n88 mg/kg (rat, oral)[7]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"[1910.1027] TWA 0.005 mg/m3 (as Cd)[6]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca[6]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [9 mg/m3 (as Cd)][6]","Other anions":"Cadmium fluoride\nCadmium bromide\nCadmium iodide","Other cations":"Zinc chloride\nMercury(II) chloride\nCalcium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
