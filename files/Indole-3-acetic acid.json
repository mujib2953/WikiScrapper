{"name":"Indole-3-acetic acid","desc":"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 3-IAA) is the most common, naturally occurring, plant hormone of the auxin class. It is the best known of the auxins, and has been the subject of extensive studies by plant physiologists. IAA is a derivative of indole, containing a carboxymethyl substituent. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in polar organic solvents.","images":[{"alt":"Indol-3-ylacetic acid.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Indol-3-ylacetic_acid.svg/200px-Indol-3-ylacetic_acid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Indole-3-acetic_acid","IUPAC name":"2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetic acid","Systematic IUPAC name":"2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethanoic acid\n2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethanoic acid","Other names":"Indole-3-acetic acid,\nindolylacetic acid,\n1H-Indole-3-acetic acid,\nindoleacetic acid,\nheteroauxin,\nIAA","CAS Number":"87-51-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16411 Y","ChemSpider":"780 Y","DrugBank":"DB07950 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.001.590","KEGG":"C00954 Y","PubChem CID":"802","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>10</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"175.19 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White solid","Melting point":"168 to 170 °C (334 to 338 °F; 441 to 443 K)","Solubility in water":"Moderate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
