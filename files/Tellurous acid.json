{"name":"Tellurous acid","desc":"Tellurous acid is an inorganic compound with the formula H2TeO3. It is the oxoacid of tellurium(IV). The compound is not well characterized. An alternative way of writing its formula is (HO)2TeO. In principle, tellurous acid would form by treatment of tellurium dioxide with water, i.e. hydrolysis. The related conjugate base is well known in the form of several salts such as potassium acid tellurite, KHTeO3.","images":[{"alt":"Tellurous Acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Tellurous_Acid.png/200px-Tellurous_Acid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tellurous_acid","IUPAC name":"Tellurous acid","Other names":"Tellurium dioxide hydrate, tellurium(IV) oxide hydrate","CAS Number":"10049-23-7 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30465 Y","ChemSpider":"23310 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.145","PubChem CID":"24936","UNII":"IVA6SGP6QM N","Chemical formula":"H<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"177.616 grams","Appearance":"colorless crystals","Density":"~ 3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Boiling point":"decomposes","Solubility in water":"negligible","Acidity (pKa)":"pKa(1) = 2.48, pKa(2) = 7.70 [1]","Crystal structure":"unknown","Molecular shape":"pyramidal at Te","Other anions":"Selenous acid\nSulfurous acid","Other cations":"Sodium tellurite","Related compounds":"Telluric acid\nSelenic acid\nSulfuric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
