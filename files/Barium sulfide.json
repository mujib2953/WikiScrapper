{"name":"Barium sulfide","desc":"Barium sulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula BaS. BaS is an important precursor to other barium compounds including BaCO3 and the pigment lithopone, ZnS/BaSO4. Like other chalcogenides of the alkaline earth metals, BaS is a short wavelength emitter for electronic displays. It is colorless, although like many sulfides, it is commonly obtained in impure colored forms.","images":[{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_sulfide","CAS Number":"21109-95-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:32590 Y","ChemSpider":"5256933 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.040.180","EC Number":"244-214-4","PubChem CID":"6857597","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Barium\">Ba</span><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"169.39 g/mol","Density":"4.25 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"1,200 °C (2,190 °F; 1,470 K)","Boiling point":"decomposes","Solubility in water":"2.88 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n7.68 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n60.3 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.155","Crystal structure":"Halite (cubic), cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (Ba2+); octahedral (S2−)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/22, R31, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S28, S61","NFPA 704":"3\n2\n0","Other anions":"Barium oxide","Other cations":"Magnesium sulfide\nCalcium sulfide\nStrontium sulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
