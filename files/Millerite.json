{"name":"Millerite","desc":"Millerite is a nickel sulfide mineral, NiS. It is brassy in colour and has an acicular habit, often forming radiating masses and furry aggregates. It can be distinguished from pentlandite by crystal habit, its duller colour, and general lack of association with pyrite or pyrrhotite.","images":[{"alt":"Millerite in geode (Hall's Gap, Kentucky, USA).jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Millerite_in_geode_%28Hall%27s_Gap%2C_Kentucky%2C_USA%29.jpg/260px-Millerite_in_geode_%28Hall%27s_Gap%2C_Kentucky%2C_USA%29.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel(II)_sulfide"}
