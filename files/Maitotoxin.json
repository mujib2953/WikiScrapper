{"name":"Maitotoxin","desc":"Maitotoxin (or MTX) is an extremely potent toxin produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus, a dinoflagellate species. Maitotoxin is so potent that it has been demonstrated that an intraperitoneal injection of 0.13 µg/kg was lethal in mice. Maitotoxin was named from the ciguateric fish Ctenochaetus striatus—called \"maito\" in Tahiti—from which maitotoxin was isolated for the first time. It was later shown that maitotoxin is actually produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus.","images":[{"alt":"Maitotoxin.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Maitotoxin.png/200px-Maitotoxin.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the maitotoxin molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Maitotoxin-3D-vdW.png/200px-Maitotoxin-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Maitotoxin","CAS Number":"59392-53-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"25991548 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.227.039","Chemical formula":"C<sub>164</sub>H<sub>256</sub>O<sub>68</sub>S<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"3422 g/mol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
