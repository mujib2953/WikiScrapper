{"name":"Calcium hypochlorite","desc":"Calcium hypochlorite is an inorganic compound with formula Ca(ClO)2. As a mixture with lime and calcium chloride, it is marketed as chlorine powder or bleach powder for water treatment and as a bleaching agent. This compound is relatively stable and has greater available chlorine than sodium hypochlorite (liquid bleach). It is a white solid, although commercial samples appear yellow. It strongly smells of chlorine, owing to its slow decomposition in moist air. It is not highly soluble in water and is more preferably used in soft to medium-hard water. It has two forms: dry and hydrated.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium hypochlorite","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Calcium_hypochlorite.png/200px-Calcium_hypochlorite.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite","Other names":"Hypochlorous acid, calcium salt\nBleaching powder, Calcium oxychloride","CAS Number":"7778-54-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22912 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.007","EC Number":"231-908-7","PubChem CID":"24504","RTECS number":"NH3485000","UN number":"1748","Chemical formula":"Ca(OCl)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"142.98 g/mol","Appearance":"white/gray powder","Density":"2.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"100 °C (212 °F; 373 K)","Boiling point":"175 °C (347 °F; 448 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"21 g/100 mL, reacts","Solubility":"reacts in alcohol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0638","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"O (O)\n C (C)\n Xn (Xn)\n N (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R8, R22, R31, R34, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S26, S36/37/39, S45, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1\nOX","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"850 mg/kg (oral, rat)","Other anions":"Calcium chloride","Other cations":"Sodium hypochlorite","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
