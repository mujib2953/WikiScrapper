{"name":"Uranium tetrafluoride","desc":"Uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) is a green crystalline solid compound of uranium with an insignificant vapor pressure and very slight solubility in water. Uranium in its tetravalent (uranous) state is very important in different technological processes. In the uranium refining industry it is known as green salt.","images":[{"alt":"Kristallstruktur Uran(IV)-fluorid.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Kristallstruktur_Uran%28IV%29-fluorid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Uran%28IV%29-fluorid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Uranium(IV)_fluoride","IUPAC names":"Uranium(IV) fluoride\nUranium tetrafluoride","CAS Number":"10049-14-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"14676181 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.142","UNII":"PJ46VTD8B2 N","Chemical formula":"UF<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"314.02 g/mol","Appearance":"Green crystalline solid.","Density":"6.70 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid.","Melting point":"1,036 °C (1,897 °F; 1,309 K)","Boiling point":"1,417 °C (2,583 °F; 1,690 K)","Solubility in water":"Insoluble.","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic, mS60","Space group":"C2/c, No. 15","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Very toxic (T+)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R26/28, R33, R51/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S20/21, S45, S61","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Uranium(IV) chloride\nUranium(IV) bromide\nUranium(IV) iodide\nUranium dioxide","Other cations":"Thorium(IV) fluoride\nProtactinium(IV) fluoride\nNeptunium(IV) fluoride\nPlutonium(IV) fluoride","Related compounds":"Uranium hexafluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
