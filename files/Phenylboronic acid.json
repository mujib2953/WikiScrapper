{"name":"Phenylboronic acid","desc":"Phenylboronic acid or benzeneboronic acid, abbreviated as PhB(OH)2 where Ph is the phenyl group C6H5-, is a boronic acid containing a phenyl substituent and two hydroxyl groups attached to boron. Phenylboronic acid is white powder and is commonly used in organic synthesis. Boronic acids are mild Lewis acids which are generally stable and easy to handle, making them important to organic synthesis.","images":[{"alt":"Phenylboronic-acid-2D-skeletal.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Phenylboronic-acid-2D-skeletal.png/150px-Phenylboronic-acid-2D-skeletal.png"},{"alt":"Phenylboronic-acid-from-xtal-2008-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Phenylboronic-acid-from-xtal-2008-3D-balls.png/160px-Phenylboronic-acid-from-xtal-2008-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Phenylboronic_acid","CAS Number":"98-80-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:44923 Y","ChemSpider":"60191 Y","DrugBank":"DB01795 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.002.456","EC Number":"202-701-9","PubChem CID":"66827","Chemical formula":"C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>BO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"121.93 g/mol","Appearance":"white to yellow powder","Odor":"odorless","Melting point":"216 °C (421 °F; 489 K)","Solubility in water":"0.1 g/mL in MeOH","Solubility":"soluble in diethyl ether, ethanol","Acidity (pKa)":"8.83","Molecular shape":"planar","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-719.6 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"[1]","R-phrases (outdated)":"22","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"740 mg/ml (rat, oral)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
