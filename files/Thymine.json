{"name":"Thymine","desc":"Thymine /ˈθaɪmᵻn/ (T, Thy) is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of DNA that are represented by the letters G–C–A–T. The others are adenine, guanine, and cytosine. Thymine is also known as 5-methyluracil, a pyrimidine nucleobase. In RNA, thymine is replaced by the nucleobase uracil. Thymine was first isolated in 1893 by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann from calves' thymus glands, hence its name.","images":[{"alt":"Thymine skeletal.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Thymine_skeletal.svg/120px-Thymine_skeletal.svg.png"},{"alt":"Thymine-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Thymine-3D-balls.png/100px-Thymine-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Thymine","":"","IUPAC name":"5-Methylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione","Other names":"5-methyluracil","CAS Number":"65-71-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17821 N","ChemSpider":"1103 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.560","IUPHAR/BPS":"4581","MeSH":"Thymine","PubChem CID":"1135","UNII":"QR26YLT7LT Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"126.12 g·mol−1","Density":"1.223 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (calculated)","Melting point":"316 to 317 °C (601 to 603 °F; 589 to 590 K)","Boiling point":"335 °C (635 °F; 608 K) (decomposes)","Acidity (pKa)":"9.7","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
