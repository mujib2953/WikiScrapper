{"name":"Molybdenum(II) chloride","desc":"Molybdenum dichloride describes chemical compounds with the empirical formula MoCl2. At least two forms are known, and both have attracted much attention from academic researchers because of the unexpected structures seen for these compounds and the fact that they give rise to hundreds of derivatives. The form discussed here is Mo6Cl12. The other molybdenum(II) chloride is potassium octachlorodimolybdate.","images":[{"alt":"Mo6Cl12-xtal-1993-CM-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Mo6Cl12-xtal-1993-CM-3D-balls.png/200px-Mo6Cl12-xtal-1993-CM-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Molybdenum(II)_chloride","IUPAC name":"dodecachlorohexamolybdenum(II)","Other names":"molybdenum(II) chloride","CAS Number":"11062-51-4","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"75349","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.417","PubChem CID":"83514","Chemical formula":"Cl<sub>12</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>","Appearance":"orange solid","Solubility in water":"low"}
