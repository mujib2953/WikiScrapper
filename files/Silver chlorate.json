{"name":"Silver chlorate","desc":"Silver chlorate (AgClO3) forms white, tetragonal crystals. Like all chlorates, it is water-soluble and an oxidizing agent. As a simple metal salt, it is a common chemical in basic inorganic chemistry experiments. It is light-sensitive, so it must be stored in tightly closed dark-coloured containers.","images":[{"alt":"Silver(I) chlorate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Silver-chlorate-3D-vdW.png/200px-Silver-chlorate-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Silver_chlorate","Other names":"chloric acid silver salt","CAS Number":"7783-92-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"7991255 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.122","EC Number":"232-034-9","PubChem CID":"9815505","Chemical formula":"AgClO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"191.319 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystals","Density":"4.443 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"230 °C (446 °F; 503 K)","Boiling point":"250 °C (482 °F; 523 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"slightly soluble","Solubility":"soluble in water and ethanol alcohol","Crystal structure":"tetragonal","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1\nOX","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
