{"name":"Beryl","desc":"Beryl is a mineral composed of beryllium aluminium cyclosilicate with the chemical formula Be3Al2(SiO3)6. Well-known varieties of beryl include emerald and aquamarine. Naturally occurring, hexagonal crystals of beryl can be up to several meters in size, but terminated crystals[clarification needed] are relatively rare. Pure beryl is colorless, but it is frequently tinted by impurities; possible colors are green, blue, yellow, red (the rarest), and white.","images":[{"alt":"Beryl09.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Beryl09.jpg/260px-Beryl09.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Beryl"}
