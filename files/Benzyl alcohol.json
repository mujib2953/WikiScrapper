{"name":"Benzyl alcohol","desc":"Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with the formula C6H5CH2OH. The benzyl group is often abbreviated \"Bn\" (not to be confused with \"Bz\" which is used for benzoyl), thus benzyl alcohol is denoted as BnOH. Benzyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a mild pleasant aromatic odor. It is a useful solvent due to its polarity, low toxicity, and low vapor pressure. Benzyl alcohol has moderate solubility in water (4 g/100 mL) and is miscible in alcohols and diethyl ether. The anion produced by deprotonation of the alcohol group is known as benzylate or benzyloxide.","images":[{"alt":"Benzyl alcohol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Alkohol_benzylowy.svg/150px-Alkohol_benzylowy.svg.png"},{"alt":"Benzyl alcohol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Benzyl-alcohol-3D-vdW.png/100px-Benzyl-alcohol-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Benzyl_alcohol","IUPAC name":"Phenylmethanol","Other names":"Phenylcarbinol","CAS Number":"100-51-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17987 Y","ChemSpider":"13860335 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.002.600","EC Number":"202-859-9","E number":"E1519 (additional chemicals)","KEGG":"D00077 Y","PubChem CID":"244","RTECS number":"DN3150000","UNII":"LKG8494WBH Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"108.14 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Slightly aromatic","Density":"1.044 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"−15.2 °C (4.6 °F; 257.9 K)","Boiling point":"205.3 °C (401.5 °F; 478.4 K)","Solubility in water":"3.50 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n4.29 g/100 mL (25 °C)","Solubility in other solvents":"Soluble[vague] in benzene, methanol, chloroform, ethanol, ether, acetone","log P":"1.10","Vapor pressure":"0.18 kPa (60 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"15.40","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-71.83·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.5396","Viscosity":"5.474 cP","Dipole moment":"1.67 D","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"217.8 J/K mol","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-352 kJ/mol","ATC code":"P03AX06 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"1\n1\n0","Flash point":"93 °C (199 °F; 366 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"436 °C (817 °F; 709 K)","Explosive limits":"1.3–13%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1250 mg/kg (rat, oral)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
