{"name":"Arsenic tribromide","desc":"Arsenic tribromide is the inorganic compound with the formula AsBr3. This pyramidal molecule is the only known binary arsenic bromide. AsBr3 is noteworthy for its very high refractive index of approximately 2.3. It also has a very high diamagnetic susceptibility. The compound exists as colourless deliquescent crystals that fume in moist air.","images":[{"alt":"Ball and stick model of arsenic tribromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Arsenic-tribromide-3D-balls.png/200px-Arsenic-tribromide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Arsenic_tribromide","Preferred IUPAC name":"Arsenic tribromide\nArsenic tribromide","Systematic IUPAC name":"Tribromoarsane\nTribromoarsane","Other names":"Arsenic(III) bromide\nArsenous bromide","CAS Number":"7784-33-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22973 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.143","EC Number":"232-057-4","PubChem CID":"24569","RTECS number":"CG1375000","Chemical formula":"AsBr<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"314.634 g/mol","Appearance":"white to pale yellow crystalline solid","Density":"3.54 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"31.1 °C (88.0 °F; 304.2 K)","Boiling point":"221 °C (430 °F; 494 K)","Solubility in water":"soluble,partial hydrolysis indicated by fumes","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-106.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.3","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"[1910.1018] TWA 0.010 mg/m3[1]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca C 0.002 mg/m3 [15-minute][1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [5 mg/m3 (as As)][1]","Related compounds":"Phosphorus tribromide\narsenic trichloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
