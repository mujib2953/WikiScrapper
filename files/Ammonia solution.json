{"name":"Ammonia solution","desc":"Ammonia solution, also known as ammonia water, ammonical liquor, ammonia liquor, aqua ammonia, aqueous ammonia, or (inaccurately) ammonia, is a solution of ammonia in water. It can be denoted by the symbols NH3(aq). It is sometimes thought of as a solution of ammonium hydroxide. Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests an alkali with composition [NH4+][OH−], it is actually impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions NH4+ and OH− do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the ammonia molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Ammonia-3D-balls.png/100px-Ammonia-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the ammonium cation","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Ammonium-3D-balls.png/100px-Ammonium-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_hydroxide","":"","CAS Number":"1336-21-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18219 Y","ChemSpider":"14218 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.014.225","E number":"E527 (acidity regulators, ...)","KEGG":"C01358 N","UNII":"5138Q19F1X Y","Chemical formula":"NH<sub>4</sub>OH or NH<sub>5</sub>O","Molar mass":"35.04 g/mol","Appearance":"Colourless liquid","Odor":"\"Fishy\", highly pungent","Density":"0.91&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (25% w/w)<br>\n0.88&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (35% w/w)","Melting point":"−57.5 °C (−71.5 °F; 215.7 K) (25% w/w)\n−91.5 °C (35% w/w)","Boiling point":"37.7 °C (99.9 °F; 310.8 K) (25% w/w)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-31.5·10−6 cm3/mol","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"111 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−80 kJ·mol−1[2]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"N  C","R-phrases (outdated)":"R34, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S26, S36/37/39, S45, S61","Other anions":"Ammonium chloride\nAmmonium cyanide","Other cations":"Tetramethylammonium hydroxide","Related compounds":"Ammonia\nHydroxylamine","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
