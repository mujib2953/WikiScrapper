{"name":"Pyrite","desc":"The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS2. This mineral's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold. The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle, and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal.","images":[{"alt":"2780M-pyrite1.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/2780M-pyrite1.jpg/260px-2780M-pyrite1.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Pyrite"}
