{"name":"Phosphoryl chloride","desc":"Phosphoryl chloride (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a colourless liquid with the formula POCl3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially on a large scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.","images":[{"alt":"Phosphoryl chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Phosphorus_oxytrichloride.PNG/175px-Phosphorus_oxytrichloride.PNG"},{"alt":"Phosphoryl-chloride-3D-vdW.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Phosphoryl-chloride-3D-vdW.png/100px-Phosphoryl-chloride-3D-vdW.png"},{"alt":"POCl3.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/POCl3.jpg/200px-POCl3.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Phosphoryl_chloride","":"","IUPAC names":"Phosphoryl trichloride\nPhosphorus trichloride oxide","Other names":"Phosphorus oxychloride\nPhosphoric trichloride\nTrichlorophosphate","CAS Number":"10025-87-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30336 Y","ChemSpider":"23198 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.030","EC Number":"233-046-7","PubChem CID":"24813","RTECS number":"TH4897000","UNII":"9XM78OL22K N","UN number":"1810","Chemical formula":"POCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"153.33 g/mol","Appearance":"Clear, colourless liquid, fumes in moist air","Odor":"pungent and musty","Density":"1.645 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, liquid","Melting point":"1.25 °C (34.25 °F; 274.40 K)","Boiling point":"105.8 °C (222.4 °F; 378.9 K)","Solubility in water":"Reacts","Vapor pressure":"40 mmHg (27°C)[1]","Molecular shape":"tetrahedral","Dipole moment":"2.54 D","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nICSC 0190","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Very toxic (T+)\nHarmful (Xn)\nCorrosive (C)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R14, R22, R26, R35, R48/23","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S7/8, S26, S36/37/39, S45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2\nW","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.1 ppm (0.6 mg/m3) ST 0.5 ppm (3 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[1]","Related compounds":"Thiophosphoryl chloride\nPhosphorus oxybromide\nPhosphorus trichloride\nPhosphorus pentachloride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
