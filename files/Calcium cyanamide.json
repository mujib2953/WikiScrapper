{"name":"Calcium cyanamide","desc":"Calcium cyanamide is the inorganic compound with the formula CaCN2. This calcium derivative of cyanamide (CN22−) is used as fertilizer, first synthesized in 1898 by Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro (Frank-Caro process). It is commercially known as nitrolime.","images":[{"alt":"CaCN2Xray.tif","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/CaCN2Xray.tif/lossless-page1-200px-CaCN2Xray.tif.png"},{"alt":"Calcium cyanamide.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Calcium_cyanamide.png/200px-Calcium_cyanamide.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_cyanamide","IUPAC name":"Calcium cyanamide","Other names":"Cyanamide calcium salt, Lime Nitrogen, UN 1403, Nitrolime","CAS Number":"156-62-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"10669887 Y\n21106503 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.330","EC Number":"205-861-8","PubChem CID":"4685067","RTECS number":"GS6000000","UNII":"ZLR270912W Y","UN number":"1403","Chemical formula":"CaCN<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"80.102 g/mol","Appearance":"White solid (Often gray or black from impurities)","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.29 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,340 °C (2,440 °F; 1,610 K)[1]","Boiling point":"1,150 to 1,200 °C (2,100 to 2,190 °F; 1,420 to 1,470 K) (sublimes)","Solubility in water":"Reacts","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1639","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nIrritant (Xi)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22 R37 R41","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2) S22 S26 S36/37/39","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1\nW","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[2]","Related compounds":"Cyanamide\nCalcium carbide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
