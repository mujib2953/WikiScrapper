{"name":"Kinetin","desc":"Kinetin (/'kaɪnɪtɪn/) is a type of cytokinin, a class of plant hormone that promotes cell division. Kinetin was originally isolated by Miller and Skoog et al. as a compound from autoclaved herring sperm DNA that had cell division-promoting activity. It was given the name kinetin because of its ability to induce cell division, provided that auxin was present in the medium. Kinetin is often used in plant tissue culture for inducing formation of callus (in conjunction with auxin) and to regenerate shoot tissues from callus (with lower auxin concentration).","images":[{"alt":"Kinetin.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Kinetin.png/90px-Kinetin.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Kinetin","IUPAC name":"N6-furfuryladenine","CAS Number":"525-79-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:27407 N","ChemSpider":"3698= N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.007.622","EC Number":"208-382-2","KEGG":"C08272 N","PubChem CID":"3830","RTECS number":"AU6270000","UNII":"P39Y9652YJ Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>10</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"215.22 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Off-white amorphous powder","Melting point":"269–271 °C (516–520 °F; 542–544 K) (decomposes)","Crystal structure":"cubic","S-phrases (outdated)":"S22 S24/25","Related":"cytokinin","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
