{"name":"Tungsten hexachloride","desc":"Tungsten hexachloride is the chemical compound of tungsten and chlorine with the formula WCl6. This dark violet blue species exists as a volatile solid under standard conditions. It is an important starting reagent in the preparation of tungsten compounds. WCl6 is a rare example of a charge-neutral hexachloride, another example being ReCl6. Better known than WCl6 is the still more volatile WF6.","images":[{"alt":"Tungsten hexachloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Hexachlorotungsten.svg/115px-Hexachlorotungsten.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tungsten(VI)_chloride","":"","IUPAC names":"Tungsten hexachloride\nTungsten(VI) chloride","CAS Number":"13283-01-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.032.980","EC Number":"236-293-9","PubChem CID":"83301","RTECS number":"YO7710000","Chemical formula":"WCl<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"396.61 g/mol","Appearance":"dark blue crystals, moisture sensitive","Density":"3.52 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"275 °C (527 °F; 548 K)","Boiling point":"346.7 °C (656.1 °F; 619.8 K)","Solubility in water":"hydrolyzes","Solubility in chlorocarbons":"soluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−71.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"α:rhombohedral, β: hexagonal","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","Dipole moment":"0 D","Main hazards":"oxidizer; hydrolysis releases HCl","Other anions":"Tungsten hexafluoride\nTungsten hexabromide","Other cations":"Molybdenum(V) chloride\nChromyl chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
