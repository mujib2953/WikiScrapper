{"name":"Antimony trifluoride","desc":"Antimony trifluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula SbF3. Sometimes called Swart's reagent, is one of two principal fluorides of antimony, the other being SbF5. It appears as a white solid. As well as some industrial applications, it is used as a reagent in inorganic and organofluorine chemistry.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Antimony-trifluoride-2D.png/100px-Antimony-trifluoride-2D.png"},{"alt":"Unit cell","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Antimony-trifluoride-unit-cell-1970-CM-3D-ellipsoids.png/200px-Antimony-trifluoride-unit-cell-1970-CM-3D-ellipsoids.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Antimony_trifluoride","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Antimony(III) fluoride\nAntimony(III) fluoride","Systematic IUPAC name":"Trifluorostibane\nTrifluorostibane","Other names":"Trifluoroantimony","CAS Number":"7783-56-4 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22960 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.099","EC Number":"232-009-2","PubChem CID":"24554","RTECS number":"CC5150000","UN number":"UN 2923","Chemical formula":"SbF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"178.76 g/mol","Appearance":"light gray to white crystals","Odor":"pungent","Density":"4.379 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"292 °C (558 °F; 565 K)","Boiling point":"376 °C (709 °F; 649 K)","Solubility in water":"385 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n443 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n562 g/100 mL (30 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in methanol, acetone\ninsoluble in ammonia","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-46.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oS16","Space group":"Ama2, No. 40","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"100 mg/kg","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[1]","Related compounds":"antimony pentafluoride, antimony trichloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
