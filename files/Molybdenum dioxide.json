{"name":"Molybdenum dioxide","desc":"Molybdenum dioxide is the chemical compound with the formula MoO2. It is a violet-colored solid and is a metallic conductor. It crystallizes in a monoclinic cell, and has a distorted rutile, (TiO2) crystal structure. In TiO2 the oxide anions are close packed and titanium atoms occupy half of the octahedral interstices (holes). In MoO2 the octahedra are distorted, the Mo atoms are off-centre, leading to alternating short and long Mo – Mo distances and Mo-Mo bonding. The short Mo – Mo distance is 251 pm which is less than the Mo – Mo distance in the metal, 272.5 pm. The bond length is shorter than would be expected for a single bond. The bonding is complex and involves a delocalisation of some of the Mo electrons in a conductance band accounting for the metallic conductivity.\nMoO2 can be prepared :","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Molybdenum(IV)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Molybdenum(IV) oxide","Tugarinovite":"Molybdenum dioxide\nTugarinovite","CAS Number":"18868-43-4 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.038.746","PubChem CID":"29320","Chemical formula":"MoO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"127.94 g/mol","Appearance":"brownish-violet solid","Density":"6.47 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,100 °C (2,010 °F; 1,370 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"insoluble in alkalies, HCl, HF\nslightly soluble in hot H2SO4","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+41.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Distorted rutile (tetragonal)","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (MoIV); trigonal (O−II)","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Molybdenum disulfide","Other cations":"Chromium(IV) oxide\nTungsten(IV) oxide","Related molybdenum oxides":"\"Molybdenum blue\"\nMolybdenum trioxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
