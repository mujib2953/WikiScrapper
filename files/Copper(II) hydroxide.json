{"name":"Copper(II) hydroxide","desc":"Copper(II) hydroxide is the hydroxide of the copper with the chemical formula of Cu(OH)2. It is a pale blue solid. Some forms of copper(II) hydroxide are sold as \"stabilized\" copper hydroxide, although they likely consist of a mixture of copper(II) carbonate and hydroxide. Copper hydroxide is a weak base.","images":[{"alt":"Copper(II) hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Copper%28II%29_hydroxide.JPG/200px-Copper%28II%29_hydroxide.JPG"},{"alt":"Kristallstruktur Kupfer(II)-hydroxid.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Kristallstruktur_Kupfer%28II%29-hydroxid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Kupfer%28II%29-hydroxid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Copper(II)_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Copper(II) hydroxide","Other names":"Cupric hydroxide","CAS Number":"20427-59-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"144498 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.817","KEGG":"C18712 Y","PubChem CID":"164826","UNII":"3314XO9W9A N","Chemical formula":"Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"97.561 g/mol","Appearance":"Blue or blue-green solid","Density":"3.368 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"80 °C (176 °F; 353 K) (decomposes into CuO)","Solubility in water":"negligible","Solubility product (Ksp)":"2.20 x 10−20[1]","Solubility":"insoluble in ethanol;\nsoluble in NH4OH, KCN","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+1170.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"108 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−450 kJ·mol−1","Main hazards":"Skin, Eye, & Respiratory Irritant","Safety data sheet":"http://www.sciencelab.com/xMSDS-Cupric_Hydroxide-9923594","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1000 mg/kg (oral, rat)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 1 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"TWA 100 mg/m3 (as Cu)[2]","Other anions":"Copper(II) oxide\nCopper(II) carbonate\nCopper(II) sulfate\nCopper(II) chloride","Other cations":"Nickel(II) hydroxide\nZinc hydroxide\nIron(II) hydroxide\nCobalt hydroxide","Related compounds":"Copper(I) oxide\nCopper(I) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
