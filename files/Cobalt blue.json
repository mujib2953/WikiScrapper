{"name":"Cobalt blue","desc":"Cobalt blue is a blue pigment made by sintering cobalt(II) oxide with alumina at 1200 °C. Chemically, cobalt blue pigment is cobalt(II) oxide-aluminium oxide, or cobalt(II) aluminate, CoAl2O4. Cobalt blue is lighter and less intense than the (iron-cyanide based) pigment Prussian blue. It is extremely stable and has historically been used as a coloring agent in ceramics (especially Chinese porcelain), jewelry, and paint. Transparent glasses are tinted with the silica-based cobalt pigment smalt.","images":[{"alt":"Cobalt Blue.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Cobalt_Blue.JPG/220px-Cobalt_Blue.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Cobalt(II)_aluminate","":""}
