{"name":"Fructose","desc":"Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \"fructose\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal Structure of Cyclic D-Fructose.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Skeletal_Structure_of_Cyclic_D-Fructose.svg/150px-Skeletal_Structure_of_Cyclic_D-Fructose.svg.png"},{"alt":"β-D-Fructose structure","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Beta-D-Fructofuranose.svg/200px-Beta-D-Fructofuranose.svg.png"},{"alt":"Fructose 3D ball-and-stick model.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Fructose_3D_ball-and-stick_model.png/200px-Fructose_3D_ball-and-stick_model.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/12px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Fructose","D-Fructofuranose":"D-Fructose (open-chain form)","IUPAC name":"(3R,4S)-1,3,4,5,6-Pentahydroxy-2-hexanone","[1][2]":"Fruit sugar,[1] levulose,[2] D-fructofuranose, D-fructose, D-arabino-hexulose","CAS Number":"57-48-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28645 Y","ChemSpider":"388775 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.303","EC Number":"200-333-3","KEGG":"C02336 Y","PubChem CID":"5984","UNII":"6YSS42VSEV Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>12</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"180.16 g·mol−1","Density":"1.694 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"103 °C (217 °F; 376 K)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-102.60·10−6 cm3/mol","ATC code":"V06DC02 (WHO)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"15000 mg/kg (intravenous, rabbit)[3]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).","Infobox references":"","":""}
