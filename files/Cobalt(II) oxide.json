{"name":"Cobalt(II) oxide","desc":"Cobalt(II) oxide or cobalt monoxide is an inorganic compound that appears as olive-green to red crystals, or as a greyish or black powder. It is used extensively in the ceramics industry as an additive to create blue colored glazes and enamels as well as in the chemical industry for producing cobalt(II) salts.","images":[{"alt":"Cobalt(II) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cobalt(II)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Cobalt(II) oxide","Other names":"Cobaltous oxide\nCobalt monoxide","CAS Number":"1307-96-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"8117730 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.777","EC Number":"215-154-6","PubChem CID":"9942118","RTECS number":"GG2800000","UN number":"3288","Chemical formula":"CoO","Molar mass":"74.9326 g/mol","Appearance":"black powder","Odor":"odorless","Density":"6.44 g/cm<sup>3</sup> <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"1,933 °C (3,511 °F; 2,206 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble in water[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+4900.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic, cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1551","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22, R43, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S24, S37, S60, S61","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"202 mg/kg","Other anions":"Cobalt(II) sulfide\nCobalt(II) hydroxide","Other cations":"Iron(II) oxide\nNickel(II) oxide","Related compounds":"Cobalt(II,III) oxide\nCobalt(III) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
