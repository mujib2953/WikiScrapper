{"name":"Leucine","desc":"Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L; encoded by the six codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG) is an α-amino acid used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+\n3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and an isobutyl side chain, classifying it as a nonpolar (at physiological pH) amino acid. It is essential in humans—meaning the body cannot synthesize it and thus must obtain from the diet.","images":[{"alt":"L-Leucine.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/L-Leucine.svg/200px-L-Leucine.svg.png"},{"alt":"Leucine Physiological pH.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Leucine_Physiological_pH.svg/200px-Leucine_Physiological_pH.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Leucine","IUPAC name":"Leucine","Other names":"2-Amino-4-methylpentanoic acid","CAS Number":"61-90-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:57427 Y","ChemSpider":"5880 Y","DrugBank":"DB01746 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.475","IUPHAR/BPS":"3312","KEGG":"D00030 Y","PubChem CID":"6106","UNII":"GMW67QNF9C Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>13</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"131.18 g·mol−1","Acidity (pKa)":"2.36 (carboxyl), 9.60 (amino)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-84.9·10−6 cm3/mol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
