{"name":"Hydrobromic acid","desc":"Hydrobromic acid is a strong acid formed by dissolving the diatomic molecule hydrogen bromide (HBr) in water. \"Constant boiling\" hydrobromic acid is an aqueous solution that distills at 124.3 °C and contains 47.6% HBr by weight, which is 8.89 mol/L. Hydrobromic acid has a pKa of −9, making it a stronger acid than hydrochloric acid, but not as strong as hydroiodic acid. Hydrobromic acid is one of the strongest mineral acids known.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of hydrogen bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Hydrogen-bromide-3D-vdW.svg/100px-Hydrogen-bromide-3D-vdW.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the bromide anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Bromide_ion.svg/100px-Bromide_ion.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrobromic_acid","":"","Other names":"Hydronium bromide","CAS Number":"10035-10-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:47266 Y","ChemSpider":"255 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.240.772","EC Number":"233-113-0","PubChem CID":"260","RTECS number":"MW3850000","UNII":"3IY7CNP8XJ N","Chemical formula":"HBr","Molar mass":"80.91","Appearance":"colorless/faint yellow liquid","Odor":"acrid","Density":"1.49 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (48% w/w aq.)","Melting point":"−11 °C (12 °F; 262 K) (47–49% w/w aq.)","Boiling point":"122 °C (252 °F; 395 K) at 700 mmHg (47–49% w/w aq.)","Solubility in water":"221 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n204 g/100 mL (15 °C)\n130 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"−9[1]","Viscosity":"0.84 cP (-75 °C)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"29.1 J/K mol","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"198.7 J/K mol","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-36.3 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0282","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Corrosive (C)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R34, R37","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S7/9, S26, S45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Hydrofluoric acid\nHydrochloric acid\nHydroiodic acid","Related compounds":"Hydrogen bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
