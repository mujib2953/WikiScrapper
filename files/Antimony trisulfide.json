{"name":"Antimony trisulfide","desc":"Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is found in nature as the crystalline mineral stibnite and the amorphous red mineral metastibnite. It is manufactured for use in safety matches, military ammunition, explosives and fireworks. It also is used in the production of ruby-colored glass and in plastics as a flame retardant. Historically the stibnite form was used as a grey pigment in paintings produced in the 16th century. It is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.8-2.5 eV.[citation needed] With suitable doping, p and n type materials can be produced.","images":[{"alt":"Sulfid antimonitý.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Sulfid_antimonit%C3%BD.JPG/200px-Sulfid_antimonit%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Antimony(III)_sulfide","IUPAC name":"diantimony trisulfide, antimony(III) sulfide","Other names":"antimony sulfide, antimonous sufide, antimony sesquisulfide, antimony vermilion, black antimony, sulphuret of antimony","CAS Number":"1345-04-6","ChemSpider":"17621613","ECHA InfoCard":"100.014.285","PubChem CID":"16689752","Chemical formula":"Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"339.715","Appearance":"grey / black orthorhombic crystal (stibnite)","Density":"6.5g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (stibnite)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Rubberbook87_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Rubberbook87-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"620 °C (1,148 °F; 893 K) (stibnite)<refg name = \"Rubberbook87\"/>","Boiling point":"1,150 °C (2,100 °F; 1,420 K)","Solubility in water":"0.00017 g/100 mL (18 °C)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-86.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"4.046","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"123.32 J/K mol","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-157.8 kJ/mol","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"> 2000 mg/kg (rat, oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[2]"}
