{"name":"Vanadium(III) oxide","desc":"Vanadium(III) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula V2O3. It is a black solid prepared by reduction of V2O5 with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.It is a basic oxide dissolving in acids to give solutions of vanadium(III) complexes. V2O3 has the corundum structure. It is antiferromagnetic with a critical temperature of 160 K.  At this temperature there is an abrupt change in conductivity from metallic to insulating.","images":[{"alt":"Vanadium trioxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Kristallstruktur_Aluminiumoxid.png/200px-Kristallstruktur_Aluminiumoxid.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Vanadium(III)_oxide","Other names":"Vanadium sesquioxide, Vanadic oxide","CAS Number":"1314-34-7 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.847","PubChem CID":"518710","RTECS number":"YW3050000","Chemical formula":"V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"149.881 g/mol","Appearance":"Black powder","Density":"4.87 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,940 °C (3,520 °F; 2,210 K)","Solubility in other solvents":"Insoluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+1976.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Trigonal (karelianite), hR30","Space group":"R-3c h, No. 167","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"98.07 J/mol·K [1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-121.8800 kJ/mol [1]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-113.9052 kJ/mol [1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
