{"name":"Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide","desc":"A number of chemicals are dubbed iron(III) oxide-hydroxide. These chemicals are oxide-hydroxides of iron, and may occur in anhydrous (FeO(OH)) or hydrated (FeO(OH)·nH2O) forms. The monohydrate (FeO(OH)·H2O) might otherwise be described as iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), and is also known as hydrated iron oxide or yellow iron oxide.","images":[{"alt":"Samples of iron(III) oxide-hydroxide monohydrate in a vial, and a spoon","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Hydroxid_%C5%BEelezit%C3%BD.PNG/244px-Hydroxid_%C5%BEelezit%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron(III)_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide","Other names":"Ferric acid","CAS Number":"1310-14-1 Y\n20344-49-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"82623 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.754","EC Number":"215-176-6","MeSH":"Goethite","PubChem CID":"91502","Appearance":"Vivid, dark orange, opaque crystals","Odor":"odorless","Density":"4.25 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Solubility in water":"insoluble at pH 7","Solubility product (Ksp)":"2.79×10−39 for Fe(OH)3[1]","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
