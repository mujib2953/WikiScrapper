{"name":"Methanethiol","desc":"Methanethiol /ˈmɛθeɪnˈθaɪɒl/ (also known as methyl mercaptan) is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula CH\n3SH. It is a colorless gas with a distinctive putrid smell. It is a natural substance found in the blood and brain of humans and animals, as well as in plant tissues. It is disposed of through animal feces. It also occurs naturally in certain foods, such as some nuts and cheese. It is one of the main compounds responsible for bad breath and the smell of flatus. Methanethiol is classified as a thiol and is sometimes abbreviated as MeSH. It is very flammable.","images":[{"alt":"Methanethiol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Methanethiol-2D.png/150px-Methanethiol-2D.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the methanethiol molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Methanethiol-3D-balls.png/100px-Methanethiol-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Methanethiol","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Methanethiol\nMethanethiol","Other names":"Methyl mercaptan\nMercaptomethane\nMethiol\nThiomethyl alcohol\nMethylthiol","CAS Number":"74-93-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16007 Y","ChemSpider":"855 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.748","KEGG":"C00409 Y","UNII":"2X8406WW9I Y","Chemical formula":"CH<sub>4</sub>S","Molar mass":"48.11 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless gas[1]","Odor":"Rotten cabbage, flatulence","Density":"0.9 g/mL (liquid at 0&#xB0;C)<sup id=\"cite_ref-PGCH_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-PGCH-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−123 °C (−189 °F; 150 K)","Boiling point":"5.95 °C (42.71 °F; 279.10 K)","Solubility in water":"2%","Solubility":"alcohol, ether","Vapor pressure":"1.7 atm (20°C)[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"~10.4","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"F+  T  N","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12, R23, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"S16, S25, S33S60, S61","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n1","Flash point":"−18 °C; 0 °F; 255 K [1]","Explosive limits":"3.9%-21.8%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"60.67 mg/kg (mammal)[2]","LC50 (median concentration)":"3.3 ppm (mouse, 2 hr)\n675 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"C 10 ppm (20 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"C 0.5 ppm (1 mg/m3) [15-minute][1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"150 ppm[1]","Related compounds":"Ethanethiol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
