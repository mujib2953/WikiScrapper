{"name":"Zinc peroxide","desc":"Zinc peroxide (ZnO2) appears as a bright yellow powder at room temperature. It was historically used as a surgical antiseptic. More recently zinc peroxide has also been used as an oxidant in explosives and pyrotechnic mixtures. Its properties have been described as a transition between ionic and covalent peroxides. Zinc peroxide can be synthesized through the reaction of zinc chloride and hydrogen peroxide.","images":[{"alt":"Zinc peroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/FeS2structure.jpg/200px-FeS2structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_peroxide","Other names":"zinc dioxide\nzinc bioxide","CAS Number":"1314-22-3 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.843","PubChem CID":"10129902","Chemical formula":"ZnO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"97.408 g/mol","Appearance":"white-yellowish powder","Density":"1.57 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"212 °C (414 °F; 485 K) (decomposes)","Acidity (pKa)":"~7 (3% solution)","Band gap":"3.8 eV (indirect) [1]","Crystal structure":"Cubic","Space group":"Pa-3","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
