{"name":"Silver bromide","desc":"Silver bromide (AgBr), a soft, pale-yellow, water-insoluble salt well known (along with other silver halides) for its unusual sensitivity to light. This property has allowed silver halides to become the basis of modern photographic materials. AgBr is widely used in photographic films and is believed by some to have been used for making the Shroud of Turin. The salt can be found naturally as the mineral bromargyrite (bromyrite).","images":[{"alt":"Bromid stříbrný.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Bromid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG/100px-Bromid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Silver_bromide","":"","bromargyrite":"bromargyrite\nbromyrite\nsilver(I) bromide","CAS Number":"7785-23-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"59584 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.160","Chemical formula":"AgBr","Molar mass":"187.77 g/mol","Appearance":"Pale yellow solid\nphotosensitive","Density":"6.473 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"432 °C (810 °F; 705 K)","Boiling point":"1,502 °C (2,736 °F; 1,775 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"0.140 mg/L (20 °C)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"5.4 × 10 −13","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohol, most acids\nsparingly soluble in ammonia\nsoluble in alkali cyanide solutions","Band gap":"2.5 eV","Electron mobility":"4000 cm2/(V·s)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−59.7·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.253","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"270 J/(kg·K)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"107 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−100 kJ·mol−1[1]","Other anions":"Silver(I) fluoride\nSilver chloride\nSilver iodide","Other cations":"Copper(I) bromide\nMercury(I) bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
