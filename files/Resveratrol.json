{"name":"Resveratrol","desc":"Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a stilbenoid, a type of natural phenol, and a phytoalexin produced by several plants in response to injury or, when the plant is under attack by pathogens such as bacteria or fungi. Sources of resveratrol in food include the skin of grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries.","images":[{"alt":"Chemical 9–69 structure of trans-resveratrol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Resveratrol.svg/250px-Resveratrol.svg.png"},{"alt":"Chemical structure of trans-resveratrol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Resveratrol3d.png/180px-Resveratrol3d.png"},{"alt":"Chemical structures of cis- and trans-resveratrols","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Cis_and_trans_resveratrol.PNG/250px-Cis_and_trans_resveratrol.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Resveratrol","Other names":"trans-3,5,4′-Trihydroxystilbene;\n3,4′,5-Stilbenetriol;\ntrans-Resveratrol;\n(E)-5-(p-Hydroxystyryl)resorcinol;\n(E)-5-(4-hydroxystyryl)benzene-1,3-diol","CAS Number":"501-36-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:45713 Y","ChemSpider":"392875 Y","DrugBank":"DB02709 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.121.386","KEGG":"C03582 Y","PubChem CID":"445154","RTECS number":"CZ8987000","UNII":"Q369O8926L Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>14</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>12</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"228.25 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white powder with\nslight yellow cast","Melting point":"261 to 263 °C (502 to 505 °F; 534 to 536 K)[2]","Solubility in water":"0.03 g/L","Solubility in DMSO":"16 g/L","Solubility in ethanol":"50 g/L","UV-vis (λmax)":"304nm (trans-resveratrol, in water)\n286nm (cis-resveratrol, in water)[1]","Safety data sheet":"Fisher Scientific[2]\nSigma Aldrich[3]","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36 (irritating to eyes)[3]","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26 (in case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice)[3]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"23.2 µM (5.29 g)[4]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
