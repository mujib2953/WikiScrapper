{"name":"Potassium sulfide","desc":"Potassium sulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula K2S. The colourless solid is rarely encountered, because it reacts readily with water, a reaction that affords potassium hydrosulfide (KSH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Most commonly, the term potassium sulfide refers loosely to this mixture, not the anhydrous solid.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium sulfide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Potassium-sulfide-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png/200px-Potassium-sulfide-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_sulfide","IUPAC name":"Potassium sulfide","Other names":"Dipotassium monosulfide,\nDipotassium sulfide,\nPotassium monosulfide,\nPotassium sulfide","CAS Number":"1312-73-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"142491","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.816","PubChem CID":"162263","RTECS number":"TT6000000","Chemical formula":"K<sub>2</sub>S","Molar mass":"110.262 g/mol","Appearance":"pure: colourless\nimpure: yellow-brown","Odor":"H2S","Density":"1.74 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"840 °C (1,540 °F; 1,110 K)","Boiling point":"912 °C (1,674 °F; 1,185 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"converts to KSH, KOH","Solubility in other solvents":"soluble in ethanol, glycerol\ninsoluble in ether","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−60.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"antiFluorite","Main hazards":"Dangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R17, R23, R25, R31, R34, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"S24, S26","Other cations":"Sodium sulfide, Iron(II) sulfide","Related compounds":"Potassium hydrosulfide, Potassium sulfite, Potassium sulfate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
