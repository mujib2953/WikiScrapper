{"name":"Ferulic acid","desc":"Ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid, a type of organic compound. It is an abundant phenolic phytochemical found in plant cell wall components such as arabinoxylans as covalent side chains. It is related to trans-cinnamic acid. As a component of lignin, ferulic acid is a precursor in the manufacture of other aromatic compounds. The etymology is from the genus Ferula, referring to the giant fennel (Ferula communis).","images":[{"alt":"Ferulic acid acsv.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Ferulic_acid_acsv.svg/200px-Ferulic_acid_acsv.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ferulic-acid-3D.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Ferulic-acid-3D.png/200px-Ferulic-acid-3D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ferulic_acid","IUPAC name":"(E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)prop-2-enoic acid","Other names":"2-propenoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-\nferulic acid\n3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid\n3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acrylic acid\n3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid\n4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid\n(2E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid\nFerulate\nConiferic acid\ntrans-ferulic acid\n(E)-ferulic acid","CAS Number":"1135-24-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17620 Y","ChemSpider":"393368 Y","DrugBank":"DB07767 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.173","PubChem CID":"445858","Chemical formula":"C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"194.18 g/mol","Appearance":"Crystalline Powder","Melting point":"168 to 172 °C (334 to 342 °F; 441 to 445 K)","Solubility in water":"0.78 g/L[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"4.61[1]","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
