{"name":"Gallium(III) hydroxide","desc":"Gallium hydroxide, Ga(OH)3 is formed as a gel following the addition of ammonia to Ga3+ salts. It is also found in nature as the rare mineral söhngeite which is reported to contain octahedrally coordinated gallium atoms Gallium hydroxide is amphoteric. In strongly acidic conditions, the gallium ion, Ga3+ is formed. In strongly basic conditions, Ga(OH)4− is formed. Salts of Ga(OH)4− are sometimes called gallates.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Gallium(III)_hydroxide","Other names":"Gallium trihydroxide","CAS Number":"12023-99-3 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8329553 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.521","PubChem CID":"10154045","Chemical formula":"Ga(OH)<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"120.7437 g/mol","Other cations":"aluminium hydroxide,\nIndium(III) hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
