{"name":"Methyl acetate","desc":"Methyl acetate, also known as MeOAc, acetic acid methyl ester or methyl ethanoate, is a carboxylate ester with the formula CH3COOCH3. It is a flammable liquid with a characteristically pleasant smell reminiscent of some glues and nail polish removers. Methyl acetate is occasionally used as a solvent, being weakly polar and lipophilic, but its close relative ethyl acetate is a more common solvent being less toxic and less soluble in water. Methyl acetate has a solubility of 25% in water at room temperature. At elevated temperature its solubility in water is much higher. Methyl acetate is not stable in the presence of strong aqueous bases or aqueous acids. Methyl acetate is not considered as a VOC.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of methyl acetate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Methyl_acetate.svg/150px-Methyl_acetate.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the methyl acetate molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Methyl_acetate_3D_ball.png/180px-Methyl_acetate_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Methyl_acetate","Preferred IUPAC name":"Methyl acetate\nMethyl acetate","Systematic IUPAC name":"Methyl ethanoate\nMethyl ethanoate","Other names":"Methyl ester of acetic acid","CAS Number":"79-20-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:77700 N","ChemSpider":"6335 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.001.078","KEGG":"C17530 Y","PubChem CID":"6584","UNII":"W684QT396F Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"74.08 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Fragrant, fruity[2]","Density":"0.932 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"−98 °C (−144 °F; 175 K)","Boiling point":"56.9 °C (134.4 °F; 330.0 K)","Solubility in water":"~25% (20 °C)","Vapor pressure":"173 mmHg (20°C)[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-42.60·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.361","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"3\n1","Flash point":"−10 °C; 14 °F; 263 K [2]","Explosive limits":"3.1%-16%[2]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"3700 mg/kg (oral, rabbit)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"11,039 ppm (mouse, 4 hr)\n21,753 ppm (cat, 1 hr)\n32,000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 200 ppm (610 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 200 ppm (610 mg/m3) ST 250 ppm (760 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"3100 ppm[2]","Related esters":"Methyl formate\nEthyl acetate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
