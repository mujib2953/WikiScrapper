{"name":"Pyrosulfate","desc":"In chemistry, disulfate or pyrosulfate is the anion with the molecular formula S\n2O2−\n7. Disulfate is the IUPAC name.  It has a dichromate-like structure and can be visualised as two corner-sharing SO4 tetrahedra, with a bridging oxygen atom. In this anion, sulfur has an oxidation state of +6. Disulfate is the conjugate base of the hydrogen disulfate (hydrogen pyrosulfate) ion HS\n2O−\n7, which in turn is the conjugate base of disulfuric acid (pyrosulfuric acid).","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Disulfate"}
