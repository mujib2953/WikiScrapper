{"name":"Aluminium oxide","desc":"Aluminium oxide (British English) or aluminum oxide (American English) is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula Al2O3. It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides, and specifically identified as aluminium(III) oxide. It is commonly called alumina, and may also be called aloxide, aloxite, or alundum depending on particular forms or applications. It occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase α-Al2O3 as the mineral corundum, varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire. Al2O3 is significant in its use to produce aluminium metal, as an abrasive owing to its hardness, and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point.","images":[{"alt":"Corundum-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Corundum-3D-balls.png/250px-Corundum-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Aluminium oxide2.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Aluminium_oxide2.jpg/200px-Aluminium_oxide2.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_oxide","CAS Number":"1344-28-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"8164808 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.014.265","PubChem CID":"9989226","RTECS number":"BD120000","UNII":"LMI26O6933 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Aluminium\">Al</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"101.96 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"3.986 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,072 °C (3,762 °F; 2,345 K)[1]","Boiling point":"2,977 °C (5,391 °F; 3,250 K)[2]","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"insoluble in diethyl ether\npractically insoluble in ethanol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-37.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Thermal conductivity":"30 W·m−1·K−1[3]","Refractive index (nD)":"nω=1.768–1.772\nnε=1.760–1.763\nBirefringence 0.008","Crystal structure":"Trigonal, hR30, space group = R3c, No. 167","Lattice constant":"a = 478.5 pm, c = 1299.1 pm","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"50.92 J·mol−1·K−1[4]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−1675.7 kJ·mol−1[4]","ATC code":"D10AX04 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Not listed.","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"OSHA 15 mg/m3 (Total Dust)\nOSHA 5 mg/m3 (Respirable Fraction)\nACGIH/TLV 10 mg/m3","REL (Recommended)":"none[5]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[5]","Other anions":"aluminium hydroxide","Other cations":"boron trioxide\ngallium oxide\nindium oxide\nthallium oxide","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
