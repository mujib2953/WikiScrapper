{"name":"Cyanuric acid","desc":"Cyanuric acid or 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triol is a chemical compound with the formula (CNOH)3. Like many industrially useful chemicals, this triazine has many synonyms. This white, odorless solid finds use as a precursor or a component of bleaches, disinfectants, and herbicides. In 1997, worldwide production was 160 million kilograms.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formulae of both tautomers","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Cyanuric_acid.png/200px-Cyanuric_acid.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the triol tautomer","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Cyanuric-acid-triol-3D-balls.png/100px-Cyanuric-acid-triol-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cyanuric_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"1,3,5-Triazinane-2,4,6-trione[1]\n1,3,5-Triazinane-2,4,6-trione[1]","[1]":"1,3,5-Triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione[1]\n1,3,5-Triazinetriol\ns-Triazinetriol\ns-Triazinetrione\nTricarbimide\nIsocyanuric acid\nPseudocyanuric acid","CAS Number":"108-80-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17696 Y","ChemSpider":"7668 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.290","KEGG":"C06554 Y","PubChem CID":"7956","RTECS number":"XZ1800000","Chemical formula":"C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"129.07 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystalline powder","Density":"2.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"320–360 °C (608–680 °F; 593–633 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"0.27 g/100 ml (25 °C)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-61.5·10−6 cm3/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1313","Related triazines":"Cyanuric fluoride\nCyanuric chloride\nCyanuric bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
