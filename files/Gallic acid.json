{"name":"Gallic acid","desc":"Gallic acid (also known as 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) is a trihydroxybenzoic acid, a type of phenolic acid, found in gallnuts, sumac, witch hazel, tea leaves, oak bark, and other plants. The chemical formula of gallic acid is C6H2(OH)3COOH. It is found both free and as part of hydrolyzable tannins. The gallic acid groups are usually bonded to form dimers such as ellagic acid. Hydrolyzable tannins break down on hydrolysis to give gallic acid and glucose or ellagic acid and glucose, known as gallotannins and ellagitannins, respectively.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Gallic_acid.svg/120px-Gallic_acid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Gallic_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"3,4,5-Trihydroxybenzoic acid\n3,4,5-Trihydroxybenzoic acid","Other names":"Gallic acid","CAS Number":"149-91-7 Y\n5995-86-8 (monohydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30778 Y","ChemSpider":"361 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.228","EC Number":"205-749-9","IUPHAR/BPS":"5549","KEGG":"C01424 Y","PubChem CID":"370","RTECS number":"LW7525000","UNII":"632XD903SP Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"170.12 g/mol","Appearance":"White, yellowish-white, or\npale fawn-colored crystals.","Density":"1.694 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)","Melting point":"260 °C (500 °F; 533 K)","Solubility in water":"1.19 g/100 mL, 20°C (anhydrous)\n1.5 g/100 mL, 20 °C (monohydrate)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ether, glycerol, acetone\nnegligible in benzene, chloroform, petroleum ether","log P":"0.70","Acidity (pKa)":"COOH: 4.5, OH: 10.","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-90.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n1","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"5000 mg/kg (rabbit, oral)","Related":"phenols,\ncarboxylic acids","Related compounds":"Benzoic acid, Phenol, Pyrogallol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
