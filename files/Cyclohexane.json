{"name":"Cyclohexane","desc":"Cyclohexane is a cycloalkane with the molecular formula C6H12 (the alkyl is abbreviated Cy). Cyclohexane is mainly used for the industrial production of adipic acid and caprolactam, which are precursors to nylon. Cyclohexane is a colourless, flammable liquid with a distinctive detergent-like odor, reminiscent of cleaning products (in which it is sometimes used).","images":[{"alt":"Cyclohexane","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Cyclohexane-2D-skeletal.svg/100px-Cyclohexane-2D-skeletal.svg.png"},{"alt":"Skeletal formula of cyclohexane in its chair conformation","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Cyclohexane-chair-2D-stereo-skeletal.png/100px-Cyclohexane-chair-2D-stereo-skeletal.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cyclohexane","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Cyclohexane[1]\nCyclohexane[1]","citation needed":"Hexanaphthene[citation needed]","CAS Number":"110-82-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29005 Y","ChemSpider":"7787 Y","DrugBank":"DB03561 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.461","KEGG":"C11249 Y","PubChem CID":"8078","UNII":"48K5MKG32S Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>12</sub>","Molar mass":"84.16 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Sweet, gasoline-like","Density":"0.7781 g/mL, liquid","Melting point":"6.47 °C (43.65 °F; 279.62 K)","Boiling point":"80.74 °C (177.33 °F; 353.89 K)","Solubility in water":"Immiscible","Solubility":"Soluble in ether, alcohol, acetone\nMiscible with olive oil","Vapor pressure":"78 mmHg (20 °C)[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-68.13·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.42662","Viscosity":"1.02 cP at 17 °C","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-156 kJ/mol","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"-3920 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"F  Xn  N","R-phrases (outdated)":"R11, R38, R65, R67, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S9, S16, S25, S33, S60, S61, S62","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"−20 °C (−4 °F; 253 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"245 °C (473 °F; 518 K)","Explosive limits":"1.3%-8%[2]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"12705 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n813 mg/kg (mouse, oral)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"17,142 ppm (mouse, 2 hr)\n26,600 ppm (rabbit, 1 hr)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 300 ppm (1050 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 300 ppm (1050 mg/m3)[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1300 ppm[2]","Related cycloalkanes":"Cyclopentane\nCycloheptane","Related compounds":"Cyclohexene\nBenzene","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
