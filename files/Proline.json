{"name":"Proline","desc":"Proline (abbreviated as Pro or P; encoded by the codons CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated NH2+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain pyrrolidine, classifying it as a nonpolar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it from the non-essential amino acid L-glutamate.","images":[{"alt":"Physiological model of proline","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/L-Proline_%28At_physiological_pH%29.svg/200px-L-Proline_%28At_physiological_pH%29.svg.png"},{"alt":"Structural formula of proline","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Prolin_-_Proline.svg/220px-Prolin_-_Proline.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Proline","IUPAC name":"Proline","Systematic IUPAC name[1]":"Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid[1]\nPyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid[1]","CAS Number":"609-36-9 Y\n344-25-2 (R) Y\n147-85-3 (S) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","Beilstein Reference":"80812","ChEBI":"CHEBI:26271 Y","ChemSpider":"594 Y\n8640 (R) Y\n128566 (S) Y","DrugBank":"DB00172 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.009.264","EC Number":"210-189-3","Gmelin Reference":"26927","KEGG":"C16435 Y","MeSH":"Proline","PubChem CID":"614\n8988 (R)\n145742 (S)","RTECS number":"TW3584000","UNII":"DCS9E77JPQ Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"115.13 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Transparent crystals","Melting point":"205 to 228 °C (401 to 442 °F; 478 to 501 K) (decomposes)","Solubility":"1.5g/100g ethanol 19 degC[2]","log P":"-0.06","Acidity (pKa)":"1.99 (carboxyl), 10.96 (amino)[3]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","S-phrases (outdated)":"S22, S24/25","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
