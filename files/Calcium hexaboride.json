{"name":"Calcium hexaboride","desc":"Calcium hexaboride (sometimes calcium boride) is a compound of calcium and boron with the chemical formula CaB6. It is an important material due to its high electrical conductivity, hardness, chemical stability, and melting point. It is a black, lustrous, chemically inert powder with a low density. It has the cubic structure typical for metal hexaborides, with octahedral units of 6 boron atoms combined with calcium atoms. CaB6 and lanthanum-doped CaB6 both show weak ferromagnetic properties, which is a remarkable fact because calcium and boron are neither magnetic, nor have inner 3d or 4f electronic shells, which are usually required for ferromagnetism.","images":[{"alt":"CaHexaboride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/CaHexaboride.jpg/200px-CaHexaboride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_boride","IUPAC name":"Calcium hexaboride","Other names":"Calcium boride","CAS Number":"12007-99-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"24765176 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.374","EC Number":"234-525-3","PubChem CID":"16212529","Chemical formula":"CaB<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"104.94 g/mol","Appearance":"black powder","Density":"2.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,235 °C (4,055 °F; 2,508 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Crystal structure":"Cubic","Space group":"Pm3m ; Oh[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
