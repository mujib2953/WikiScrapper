{"name":"Aluminium phosphate","desc":"Aluminium phosphate (AlPO4) is a chemical compound. The anhydrous form is found in nature as the mineral berlinite. Many synthetic forms of anhydrous aluminium phosphate are known. They have framework structures similar to zeolites and some are used as catalysts or molecular sieves. The dihydrate, AlPO4·2H2O is found as the minerals variscite and meta-variscite. A synthetic hydrated form, AlPO4·1.5H2O is also known. Commercially, an aluminium phosphate gel is available.","images":[{"alt":"Aluminium phosphate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Fosfore%C4%8Dnan_hlinit%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Fosfore%C4%8Dnan_hlinit%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Aluminium_phosphate","Other names":"Aluminum phosphate\nAluminium monophosphate\nPhosphoric acid, aluminium salt (1:1)","CAS Number":"7784-30-7 Y\n22784-12-9 (trihydrate)","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChemSpider":"58204 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.142","PubChem CID":"64655","RTECS number":"TB6450000","UNII":"F92V3S521O Y","Chemical formula":"AlPO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"121.9529 g/mol","Appearance":"White, crystalline powder","Density":"2.566 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"1,800 °C (3,270 °F; 2,070 K)","Boiling point":"Decomposes","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility product (Ksp)":"6.3×10−19","Solubility":"Very slightly soluble in HCl and HNO3","Refractive index (nD)":"1.546 [1]","ATC code":"A02AB03 (WHO)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Xi","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36/37/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"4640 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n> 4640 mg/kg (rabbit, dermal)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
