{"name":"1,3-Butadiene","desc":"1,3-Butadiene is a simple conjugated diene with the formula C4H6. It is an important industrial chemical used as a monomer in the production of synthetic rubber. The molecule can be viewed as two vinyl groups (CH2=CH2) joined together. The word butadiene usually refers to 1,3-butadiene, which has the structure H2C=CH−CH=CH2.","images":[{"alt":"Full structural formula of 1,3-butadiene","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Butadi%C3%A8ne.PNG/100px-Butadi%C3%A8ne.PNG"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of 1,3-butadiene","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Trans-butadiene-3D-balls.png/100px-Trans-butadiene-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/1,3-butadiene","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Buta-1,3-diene[1]\nButa-1,3-diene[1]","Other names":"Biethylene\nErythrene\nDivinyl\nVinylethylene\nBivinyl\nButadiene","CAS Number":"106-99-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:39478 Y","ChemSpider":"7557 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.138","EC Number":"271-039-0","KEGG":"C16450 Y","PubChem CID":"7845","RTECS number":"EI9275000","UNII":"JSD5FGP5VD Y","UN number":"1010","Chemical formula":"C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"54.0916 g/mol","Appearance":"Colourless gas\nor refrigerated liquid","Odor":"mildly aromatic or gasoline-like","Density":"0.6149 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C, solid<br>\n0.64 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at &#x2212;6&#xA0;&#xB0;C, liquid","Melting point":"−108.9 °C (−164.0 °F; 164.2 K)","Boiling point":"−4.4 °C (24.1 °F; 268.8 K)","Solubility in water":"0.735 g/100 mL","Solubility":"very soluble in acetone\nsoluble in ether, ethanol","Vapor pressure":"2.4 atm (20°C)[2]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4292","Viscosity":"0.25 cP at 0 °C","Main hazards":"Flammable, irritative, carcinogen","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nECSC 0017","R-phrases (outdated)":"R45 R46 R12","S-phrases (outdated)":"S45 S53","NFPA 704":"4\n3\n2","Flash point":"−85 °C (−121 °F; 188 K) liquid flash point[2]","Autoignition\ntemperature":"420 °C (788 °F; 693 K)","Explosive limits":"2–12%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"548 mg/kg (rat, oral)","LC50 (median concentration)":"115,111 ppm (mouse)\n122,000 ppm (mouse, 2 h)\n126,667 ppm (rat, 4 h)\n130,000 ppm (rat, 4 h)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"250,000 ppm (rabbit, 30 min)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 ppm ST 5 ppm[2]","REL (Recommended)":"potential occupational carcinogen[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"2000 ppm[2]","Related alkenes\nand dienes":"Isoprene\nChloroprene","Related compounds":"Butane","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
