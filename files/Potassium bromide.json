{"name":"Potassium bromide","desc":"Potassium bromide (KBr) is a salt, widely used as an anticonvulsant and a sedative in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with over-the-counter use extending to 1975 in the US. Its action is due to the bromide ion (sodium bromide is equally effective). Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, as an antiepileptic medication for dogs.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Potassium_bromide.jpg/200px-Potassium_bromide.jpg"},{"alt":"Potassium bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Potassium-bromide-3D-ionic.png/200px-Potassium-bromide-3D-ionic.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_bromide","CAS Number":"7758-02-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:32030 N","ChemSpider":"22854 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.937","PubChem CID":"24446","RTECS number":"TS7650000","UNII":"OSD78555ZM N","Chemical formula":"KBr","Molar mass":"119.002 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.74 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"734 °C (1,353 °F; 1,007 K)","Boiling point":"1,435 °C (2,615 °F; 1,708 K)","Solubility in water":"535 g/L (0 °C)\n678 g/L (25 °C)\n1020 g/L (100 °C)","Solubility":"very slightly soluble in diethyl ether","Solubility in glycerol":"217 g/L","Solubility in ethanol":"47.6 g/L (80 °C)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−49.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.559","Crystal structure":"Sodium chloride","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","Dipole moment":"10.41 D (gas)","ATCvet code":"QN03AX91 (WHO)","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"Warning","GHS hazard statements":"H319","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P305+351+338, P337+313","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"3070 mg/kg (oral, rat)[1]","Other anions":"Potassium fluoride\nPotassium chloride\nPotassium iodide\nPotassium astatide","Other cations":"Lithium bromide\nSodium bromide\nRubidium bromide\nCaesium bromide\nFrancium bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
