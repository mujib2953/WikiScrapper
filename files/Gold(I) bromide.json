{"name":"Gold(I) bromide","desc":"Gold(I) bromide can be formed by synthesis from the elements or partial decomposition of gold(III) bromide by careful control of temperatures and pressures. It occurs in two modifications. One (I-AuBr) is isostructural with gold(I) chloride and has a body centered tetragonal unit cell with a=6.734A and c=8.674A and space group I41/amd. The other is isostructural with gold(I) iodide and has a primitive tetragonal cell a=4.296A and c=12.146A and space group P42/ncm. Single crystals of both modifications have been grown by chemical vapor transport. Small amounts of Al,Ga or Fe were used as catalysts for the transport process to obtain the I-AuBr modification.","images":[{"alt":"Crystal structure of AuBr-P","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/AuBr.png/200px-AuBr.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Gold(I)_bromide","IUPAC name":"gold(I) bromide","Other names":"Aurous bromide\nGold monobromide\nGold(I) bromide","CAS Number":"10294-27-6 Y","Chemical formula":"AuBr","Molar mass":"276.87 g/mol","Appearance":"lemon yellow crystals (AuBr-I), yellow-brown (AuBr-P)","Density":"7.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"165 °C (329 °F; 438 K) (decomposes)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−61.0·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"3","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
