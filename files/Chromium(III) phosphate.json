{"name":"Chromium(III) phosphate","desc":"Chromium(III) phosphate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula CrPO4. CrPO4 normally exists as a green crystal, CrPO4•4H2O, or a violet crystal, CrPO4•6H2O, in its hydrated form. It is insoluble in water but soluble in acids. The melting point of CrPO4 stands at a temperature of 100 °C however it is a stable compound at normal temperature and pressure. Chromium(III) phosphate undergoes thermal decomposition at a high temperature of 1450 °C to yield chromium oxide and phosphorus pentaoxide. It is used as an additive in drugs, anti-corrosive pigments, catalysts and polymer manufacture.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(III)_phosphate","IUPAC name":"Chromium(III) phosphate","Other names":"Chromium phosphate, Chromium monophosphate, Chromium orthophosphate, Chromic phosphate","CAS Number":"7789-04-0\n84359-31-9 (hexahydrate)","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56424","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.219","EC Number":"232-141-0","PubChem CID":"62673","Chemical formula":"CrPO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"146.97 g/mol","Density":"4.236 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"1,907 °C (3,465 °F; 2,180 K)[1]","Boiling point":"2,671 °C (4,840 °F; 2,944 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble, exothermal blue solution[1]","Crystal structure":"monoclinic[1]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"250 mg/m3[2]"}
