{"name":"Threonine","desc":"Threonine (abbreviated as Thr or T) encoded by the codons ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+\n3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and an alcohol containing side chain, classifying it as a polar, uncharged (at physiological pH) amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and must be ingested in our diet. Threonine is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria such as E. coli.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/L-Threonin_-_L-Threonine.svg/180px-L-Threonin_-_L-Threonine.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/L-Threonine-3D-balls.png/160px-L-Threonine-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Threonine","IUPAC name":"Threonine","Other names":"2-Amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid","CAS Number":"80-68-2 Y\n72-19-5 (L-isomer) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:57926 Y","ChemSpider":"6051 Y","DrugBank":"DB00156 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.704","EC Number":"201-300-6","IUPHAR/BPS":"4785","PubChem CID":"6288","UNII":"2ZD004190S Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>9</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"119.12 g·mol−1","Solubility in water":"(H2O, g/dl) 10.6(30°),14.1(52°),19.0(61°)","Acidity (pKa)":"2.63 (carboxyl), 10.43 (amino)[1]","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
