{"name":"Niobium pentaiodide","desc":"Niobium pentaiodide is the inorganic compound with the formula Nb2I10. It is a yellow, moisture-sensitive, diamagnetic solid. It forms upon heating metallic niobium with iodine. Its structure has been verified by single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals an edge-shared bioctahedral structure, as observed for many pentahalides of Nb and Ta. The bonds to the bridging iodides are 0.3 Å longer than the terminal Nb-I bonds.","images":[{"alt":"Nb2I10.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Nb2I10.svg/200px-Nb2I10.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Niobium(V)_iodide","Other names":"Niobium(V) iodide","CAS Number":"13779-92-5","ECHA InfoCard":"100.034.006","Chemical formula":"Nb<sub>2</sub>I<sub>10</sub>","Molar mass":"1475","Appearance":"yellow solid","Density":"5.30 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"543 °C (1,009 °F; 816 K) sublimes"}
