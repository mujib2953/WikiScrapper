{"name":"Boron sulfide","desc":"Boron sulfide is the chemical compound with the formula B2S3. This polymeric material that has been of interest as a component of “high-tech” glasses and as a reagent for preparing organosulfur compounds. Like the sulfides of silicon and phosphorus, B2S3 reacts with water, including atmospheric moisture to release H2S. Thus, samples must be handled under anhydrous conditions.","images":[{"alt":"B2S3structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/B2S3structure.jpg/200px-B2S3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Boron_sulfide","IUPAC name":"Boron sulfide","Other names":"Boron trisulfide","CAS Number":"12007-33-9 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.355","Chemical formula":"B<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"117.80 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless crystals","Density":"1.55 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"563 °C (1,045 °F; 836 K)","Boiling point":"decomposes at high T","Solubility in water":"decomposes","Solubility":"soluble in ammonia","Crystal structure":"monoclinic, mP40, SpaceGroup = P21/c, No. 14","Coordination geometry":"B: planar, sp2","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"111.7 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"327 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-240.6 kJ/mol","Main hazards":"source of H2S","Related compounds":"BCl3\nLawesson's reagent","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
