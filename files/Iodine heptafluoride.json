{"name":"Iodine heptafluoride","desc":"Iodine heptafluoride, also known as iodine(VII) fluoride or iodine fluoride, is an interhalogen compound with the chemical formula IF7. It has an unusual pentagonal bipyramidal structure, as predicted by VSEPR theory. The molecule can undergo a pseudorotational rearrangement called the Bartell mechanism, which is like the Berry mechanism but for a heptacoordinated system. It forms colourless crystals, which melt at 4.5 °C: the liquid range is extremely narrow, with the boiling point at 4.77 °C. The dense vapor has a mouldy, acrid odour. The molecule has D5h symmetry.","images":[{"alt":"Structure of the iodine heptafluoride molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Iodine-heptafluoride-2D-dimensions.png/200px-Iodine-heptafluoride-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Iodine heptafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Iodine-heptafluoride-3D-balls.png/100px-Iodine-heptafluoride-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iodine_heptafluoride","":"","Other names":"Iodine(VII) fluoride\nHeptafluoroiodine","CAS Number":"16921-96-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"21477354 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.037.241","PubChem CID":"85645","Chemical formula":"IF<sub>7</sub>","Molar mass":"259.90 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless gas","Density":"2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (6 &#xB0;C)<br>\n2.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (25 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"4.5 °C (40.1 °F; 277.6 K) (triple point)","Boiling point":"4.8 °C (40.6 °F; 277.9 K) (sublimes at 1 atm)","Solubility in water":"soluble [1]","Related compounds":"iodine pentafluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
