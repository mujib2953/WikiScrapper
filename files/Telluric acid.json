{"name":"Telluric acid","desc":"Telluric acid is a chemical compound with the formula Te(OH)6. It is a white solid made up of octahedral Te(OH)6 molecules which persist in aqueous solution. There are two forms, rhombohedral and monoclinic, and both contain octahedral Te(OH)6 molecules. Telluric acid is a weak acid which is dibasic, forming tellurate salts with strong bases and hydrogen tellurate salts with weaker bases or upon hydrolysis of tellurates in water.","images":[{"alt":"Telluric acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Telluric_acid.svg/150px-Telluric_acid.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of telluric acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Telluric-acid-3D-balls.png/150px-Telluric-acid-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Telluric_acid","IUPAC name":"Hexahydroxidotellurium","Other names":"Orthotelluric acid","CAS Number":"7803-68-1 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30463 Y","ChemSpider":"55517 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.334","PubChem CID":"62686","Chemical formula":"H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>Te","Molar mass":"229.64 g/mol","Appearance":"White monoclinic crystals","Density":"3.07 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"136 °C (277 °F; 409 K)","Solubility in water":"50.1 g/100 ml at 30 °C[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"7.68, 11.0 at 18 °C[1]","Molecular shape":"octahedral","Dipole moment":"0 D","Main hazards":"corrosive","Other anions":"hydrotelluric acid\ntellurous acid\nhydrogen telluride","Related compounds":"Teflic acid,\nSulfuric acid\nSelenic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
