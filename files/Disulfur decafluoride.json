{"name":"Disulfur decafluoride","desc":"Disulfur decafluoride (S2F10) is a chemical compound discovered in 1934 by Denbigh and Whytlaw-Gray. Each S of the S2F10 molecule is octahedral, and surrounded by 5 fluorines. S2F10 is highly toxic, with toxicity 4 times that of phosgene. It was considered a potential chemical warfare pulmonary agent in World War II because it does not produce lacrimation or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure. It is produced by the electrical decomposition of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—an essentially inert insulator used in high voltage systems such as transmission lines, substations and switchgear. S2F10 is also made during the production of SF6, but is distilled out.","images":[{"alt":"Wireframe model of disulfur decafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Disulfur-decafluoride-2D-dimensions.png/210px-Disulfur-decafluoride-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of disulfur decafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Disulfur-decafluoride-3D-balls.png/130px-Disulfur-decafluoride-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Disulfur_decafluoride","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Disulfur decafluoride\nDisulfur decafluoride","Systematic IUPAC name":"Decafluoro-1λ6,2λ6-disulfane\nDecafluoro-1λ6,2λ6-disulfane","Other names":"sulfur pentafluoride","CAS Number":"5714-22-7","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56348","ECHA InfoCard":"100.024.732","EC Number":"227-204-4","MeSH":"Disulfur+decafluoride","PubChem CID":"62586","Chemical formula":"S<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub>","Molar mass":"254.1 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless liquid","Odor":"like sulfur dioxide[1]","Density":"2.08 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−53 °C (−63 °F; 220 K)","Boiling point":"30.1 °C (86.2 °F; 303.2 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble[2]","Vapor pressure":"561 mmHg (20 °C)[1]","Main hazards":"Poisonous","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"2000 mg/m3 (rat, 10 min)\n1000 mg/m3 (mouse, 10 min)\n4000 mg/m3 (rabbit, 10 min)\n4000 mg/m3 (guinea pig, 10 min)\n4000 mg/m3 (dog, 10 min)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.025 ppm (0.25 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"C 0.01 ppm (0.1 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1 ppm[1]"}
