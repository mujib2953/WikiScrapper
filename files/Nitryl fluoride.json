{"name":"Nitryl fluoride","desc":"Nitryl fluoride, NO2F, is a colourless gas and strong oxidizing agent, which is used as a fluorinating agent and has been proposed as an oxidiser in rocket propellants (though never flown). It is a molecular species, not ionic, consistent with its low boiling point. The structure features planar nitrogen with a short N-F bond length of 135 pm.","images":[{"alt":"Nitryl fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Nitryl-fluoride-2D-dimensions.png/100px-Nitryl-fluoride-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Nitryl_fluoride","":"","CAS Number":"10022-50-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"59588 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.007","EC Number":"233-021-0","PubChem CID":"66203","UNII":"DAT2I9R64A N","Chemical formula":"<a href=\"/wiki/Nitrogen\" title=\"Nitrogen\">N</a><a href=\"/wiki/Oxygen\" title=\"Oxygen\">O</a><sub>2</sub><a href=\"/wiki/Fluorine\" title=\"Fluorine\">F</a>","Molar mass":"65.0039 g/mol","Melting point":"−166 °C (−267 °F; 107 K)","Boiling point":"−72 °C (−98 °F; 201 K)","Other anions":"nitryl chloride, nitryl bromide","Other cations":"nitrosyl fluoride, sulfuryl fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
