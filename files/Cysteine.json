{"name":"Cysteine","desc":"Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH2SH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920.","images":[{"alt":"L-Cystein - L-Cysteine.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/L-Cystein_-_L-Cysteine.svg/200px-L-Cystein_-_L-Cysteine.svg.png"},{"alt":"L-cysteine-3D-balls2.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/L-cysteine-3D-balls2.png/100px-L-cysteine-3D-balls2.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cysteine","":"","IUPAC name":"Cysteine","Other names":"2-Amino-3-sulfhydrylpropanoic acid","CAS Number":"52-90-4 Y\n52-89-1 (hydrochloride) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:15356 Y","ChemSpider":"574 (Racemic) Y\n5653 (L-form) Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.145","EC Number":"200-158-2","E number":"E920 (glazing agents, ...)","IUPHAR/BPS":"4782","KEGG":"D00026 Y","PubChem CID":"5862","UNII":"K848JZ4886 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"121.15 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white crystals or powder","Melting point":"240 °C (464 °F; 513 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"soluble","Solubility":"1.5g/100g ethanol 19 degC [1]","Chiral rotation ([α]D)":"+9.4° (H2O, c = 1.3)","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
