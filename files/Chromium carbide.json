{"name":"Chromium carbide","desc":"Chromium carbide is a ceramic compound that exists in several different chemical compositions: Cr3C2, Cr7C3,and Cr23C6. At standard conditions it exists as a gray solid. It is extremely hard and corrosion resistant. It is also a refractory compound, which means that it retains its strength at high temperatures as well. These properties make it useful as an additive to metal alloys. When chromium carbide crystals are integrated into the surface of a metal it improves the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the metal, and maintains these properties at elevated temperatures. The hardest and most commonly used composition for this purpose is Cr3C2.","images":[{"alt":"Cr3C2structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cr3C2structure.jpg/200px-Cr3C2structure.jpg"},{"alt":"Chromium carbide Cr3C2.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Chromium_carbide_Cr3C2.JPG/200px-Chromium_carbide_Cr3C2.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(II)_carbide","IUPAC name":"Chromium(II) carbide","CAS Number":"12012-35-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"21171152 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.420","PubChem CID":"3650773","Chemical formula":"Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"180.009 g/mol","Appearance":"gray orthorhombic crystals","Density":"6.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,895 °C (3,443 °F; 2,168 K)","Boiling point":"3,800 °C (6,870 °F; 4,070 K)","Solubility in water":"reacts","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP20","Space group":"Pnma, No. 62","NFPA 704":"2\n1\n1","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"250 mg/m3[2]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
