{"name":"Chromium trifluoride","desc":"Chromium(III) fluoride is the name for the inorganic compounds with the chemical formula CrF3 as well as several related hydrates. The compound CrF3 is a green crystalline solid that is insoluble in common solvents, but the coloured hydrates [Cr(H2O)6]F3 and [Cr(H2O)6]F3•3H2O are soluble in water. The trihydrate is green, and the hexahydrate is violet. The anhydrous form sublimes at 1100–1200 °C.","images":[{"alt":"Aluminium-trifluoride-3D-polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Aluminium-trifluoride-3D-polyhedra.png/200px-Aluminium-trifluoride-3D-polyhedra.png"},{"alt":"FeF3structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/FeF3structure.jpg/200px-FeF3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(III)_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Chromium(III) fluoride","Other names":"Chromium trifluoride","CAS Number":"7788-97-8 Y\n16671-27-5 (trihydrate)\n123333-98-2 (tetrahydrate)","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8329529 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.216","PubChem CID":"10154021","RTECS number":"GB6125000","Chemical formula":"CrF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"108.9913 g/mol (anhydrous)\n163.037 g/mol (trihydrate)\n181.05 g/mol (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"green crystalline solid","Density":"3.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (trihydrate)","Melting point":"1,100 °C (2,010 °F; 1,370 K) (sublimes)","Solubility in water":"negligible (anhydrous)\nsparingly soluble (trihydrate)","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohols\nsoluble in HF, HCl","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+4370.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Rhombohedral, hR24","Space group":"R-3c, No. 167","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"150 mg/kg (guinea pig, oral)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 mg/m3[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"250 mg/m3[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
