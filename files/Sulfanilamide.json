{"name":"Sulfanilamide","desc":"Sulfanilamide (also spelled sulphanilamide) is a sulfonamide antibacterial. Chemically, it is an organic compound consisting of an aniline derivatized with a sulfonamide group. Powdered sulfanilamide was used by the Allies in World War II to reduce infection rates and contributed to a dramatic reduction in mortality rates compared to previous wars. Modern antibiotics have supplanted sulfanilamide on the battlefield; however, sulfanilamide remains in use for treatment of vaginal yeast infections.","images":[{"alt":"Sulfanilamide-skeletal.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Sulfanilamide-skeletal.svg/220px-Sulfanilamide-skeletal.svg.png"},{"alt":"Sulfanilamida-3D.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Sulfanilamida-3D.png/220px-Sulfanilamida-3D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sulfanilamide"}
