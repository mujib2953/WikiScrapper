{"name":"1-Propanol","desc":"1-Propanol, is a primary alcohol with the formula CH3CH2CH2OH (sometimes represented as PrOH or n-PrOH). This colorless liquid is also known as propan-1-ol, 1-propyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, and n-propanol. It is an isomer of isopropanol (2-propanol, isopropyl alcohol). It is formed naturally in small amounts during many fermentation processes and used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry mainly for resins and cellulose esters.","images":[{"alt":"Ball and stick model of 1-propanol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Propan-1-ol-3D-balls.png/200px-Propan-1-ol-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Propan-1-ol","IUPAC name[1]":"Propan-1-ol[1]","Other names":"n-Propyl alcohol\nn-Propanol\nn-PrOH\nEthylcarbinol\n1-Hydroxypropane\nPropionic alcohol\nPropionyl alcohol\nPropionylol\nPropyl alcohol\nPropylic alcohol\nPropylol\n\n\n\n\nn-Propyl alcohol\nn-Propanol\nn-PrOH\nEthylcarbinol\n1-Hydroxypropane\nPropionic alcohol\nPropionyl alcohol\nPropionylol\nPropyl alcohol\nPropylic alcohol\nPropylol","CAS Number":"71-23-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","3DMet":"B00883","Beilstein Reference":"1098242","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28831 Y","ChemSpider":"1004 Y","DrugBank":"DB03175 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.679","EC Number":"200-746-9","Gmelin Reference":"25616","KEGG":"C05979 N","MeSH":"1-Propanol","PubChem CID":"1031","RTECS number":"UH8225000","UNII":"96F264O9SV Y","UN number":"1274","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"60.10 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"mild, alcohol-like[2]","Density":".803 g/mL","Melting point":"−126 °C; −195 °F; 147 K","Boiling point":"97 to 98 °C; 206 to 208 °F; 370 to 371 K","Solubility in water":"miscible","log P":"0.329","Vapor pressure":"1.99 kPa (at 20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"16","Basicity (pKb)":"−2","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-45.176·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.387","Viscosity":"1.959 mPa·s (at 25 °C) [3]","Dipole moment":"1.68 D","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"143.96 J K−1 mol−1","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"192.8 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−302.79–−302.29 kJ mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−2.02156–−2.02106 MJ mol−1","ATC code":"D08AX03 (WHO)","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H318, H336","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P261, P280, P305+351+338","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"22 °C (72 °F; 295 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"371 °C (700 °F; 644 K)","Explosive limits":"2.2% - 13.7%[2]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2800 mg/kg (rabbit, oral)\n6800 mg/kg (mouse, oral)\n1870 mg/kg (rat, oral)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 200 ppm (500 mg/m3)[2]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 200 ppm (500 mg/m3) ST 250 ppm (625 mg/m3) [skin][2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"800 ppm[2]","Related compounds":"Propane\nIsopropyl alcohol\nPropanamine\nEthanol\nButanol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
