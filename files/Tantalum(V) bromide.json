{"name":"Tantalum(V) bromide","desc":"Tantalum(V) bromide is the inorganic compound with the formula Ta2Br10. It is a diamagnetic yellow solid that hydrolyses readily. The compound adopts an edge-shared bioctahedral structure, which means that two square pyramidal TaBr5 subunits are joined by a pair of bridging bromide ligands. The pentachlorides and pentaiodides of Nb and Ta share this structural motif.","images":[{"alt":"Tantalum(V) bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Ta2Br10.png/200px-Ta2Br10.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tantalum(V)_bromide","Other names":"tantalum pentabromide","CAS Number":"13451-11-1 TaBr5 N\n17786-61-7 Ta2Br10 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.276","EC Number":"236-618-4","PubChem CID":"83480","Chemical formula":"Ta<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>","Molar mass":"580.468 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow solid","Density":"4.99 g/cm&#xB3;, solid","Melting point":"265 °C (509 °F; 538 K)","Boiling point":"349 °C (660 °F; 622 K)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
