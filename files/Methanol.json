{"name":"Methanol","desc":"Methanol (/ˈmɛθənɒl/), also known as methyl alcohol among others, is a chemical with the formula CH3OH (often abbreviated MeOH). Methanol acquired the name \"wood alcohol\" because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood. Today, industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of methanol with some explicit hydrogens added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Methanol_Lewis.svg/100px-Methanol_Lewis.svg.png"},{"alt":"Stereo skeletal formula of methanol with all explicit hydrogen added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Methanol-2D.png/100px-Methanol-2D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Methanol","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Methanol[1]\nMethanol[1]","Other names":"Carbinol\nColumbian spirits\nHydroxymethane\nMethyl alcohol\nMethyl hydrate\nMethyl hydroxide\nMethylic alcohol\nMethylol\nPyroligneous spirit\nWood alcohol\nWood naphtha\nWood spirit","CAS Number":"67-56-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","3DMet":"B01170","Beilstein Reference":"1098229","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17790 Y","ChemSpider":"864 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.599","EC Number":"200-659-6","Gmelin Reference":"449","KEGG":"D02309 Y","MeSH":"Methanol","PubChem CID":"887","RTECS number":"PC1400000","UNII":"Y4S76JWI15 Y","UN number":"1230","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">CH<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n3</span>OH</span>","Molar mass":"32.04 g mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Density":"0.792 g&#xB7;cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−97.6 °C (−143.7 °F; 175.6 K)","Boiling point":"64.7 °C (148.5 °F; 337.8 K)","Solubility in water":"miscible","log P":"-0.69","Vapor pressure":"13.02 kPa (at 20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"15.5[3]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-21.40·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.33141[4]","Viscosity":"0.545 mPa×s (at 25 °C) [5]","Dipole moment":"1.69 D","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","GHS pictograms":"[6]","GHS signal word":"Danger [6]","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H301, H311, H331, H370[6]","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P233, P240, P241, P242, P243, P260, P264, P270, P280, P301+310, P303+361+353, P304+340, P330[6]","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"11 to 12 °C (52 to 54 °F; 284 to 285 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"470[7] °C (878 °F; 743 K)","Explosive limits":"6%-36%[8]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"5628 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n7300 mg/kg (mouse, oral)\n12880 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n14200 mg/kg (rabbit, oral)[9]","LC50 (median concentration)":"64,000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[9]","LCLo (lowest published)":"33,082 ppm (cat, 6 hr)\n37,594 ppm (mouse, 2 hr)[9]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 200 ppm (260 mg/m3)[8]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 200 ppm (260 mg/m3) ST 250 ppm (325 mg/m3) [skin][8]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"6000 ppm[8]","Related compounds":"Methanethiol\nSilanol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
