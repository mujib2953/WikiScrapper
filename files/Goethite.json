{"name":"Goethite","desc":"Goethite (FeO(OH)), ( /ˈɡɜːrtaɪt/ GUR-tite) is an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group. It is found in soil and other low-temperature environments. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany. The mineral was named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832).","images":[{"alt":"Goethite-169735.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Goethite-169735.jpg/240px-Goethite-169735.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Goethite"}
