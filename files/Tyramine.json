{"name":"Tyramine","desc":"Tyramine (also spelled tyramin) (/ˈtaɪrəmin/ TY-rə-meen), also known by several other names, is a naturally occurring trace amine derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyramine acts as a catecholamine releasing agent. Notably, it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in only non-psychoactive peripheral sympathomimetic effects following ingestion. A hypertensive crisis can result, however, from ingestion of tyramine-rich foods in conjunction with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).","images":[{"alt":"Tyramine.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Tyramine.svg/220px-Tyramine.svg.png"},{"alt":"Tyramine 3D ball.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Tyramine_3D_ball.png/220px-Tyramine_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tyramine"}
