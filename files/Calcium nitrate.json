{"name":"Calcium nitrate","desc":"Calcium nitrate, also called Norgessalpeter (Norwegian saltpeter), is the inorganic compound with the formula Ca(NO3)2. This colourless salt absorbs moisture from the air and is commonly found as a tetrahydrate. It is mainly used as a component in fertilizers but has other applications. Nitrocalcite is the name for a mineral which is a hydrated calcium nitrate that forms as an efflorescence where manure contacts concrete or limestone in a dry environment as in stables or caverns. A variety of related salts are known including calcium ammonium nitrate decahydrate and calcium potassium nitrate decahydrate.","images":[{"alt":"picture of constituent ions","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Calcium_nitrate.png/150px-Calcium_nitrate.png"},{"alt":"Dusičnan vápenatý.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Dusi%C4%8Dnan_v%C3%A1penat%C3%BD.JPG/220px-Dusi%C4%8Dnan_v%C3%A1penat%C3%BD.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_nitrate_tetrahydrate","Other names":"Kalksalpeter, nitrocalcite, Norwegian saltpeter, lime nitrate","CAS Number":"10124-37-5 Y\n13477-34-4 (tetrahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23336 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.289","PubChem CID":"24963","RTECS number":"EW2985000","UNII":"NF52F38N1N N","UN number":"1454","Chemical formula":"Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"164.088 g/mol (anhydrous)\n236.15 g/mol (tetrahydrate)","Appearance":"colorless solid\nhygroscopic","Density":"2.504 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.896 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (tetrahydrate)","Melting point":"561 °C (1,042 °F; 834 K) (anhydrous)\n42.7 °C (109 °F; 316 K) (tetrahydrate)","Boiling point":"decomposes (anhydrous)\n132 °C (270 °F; 405 K) (tetrahydrate)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous:\n1212 g/L (20 °C)\n2710 g/L (40 °C)\n\ntetrahydrate:\n1050 g/L (0 °C)\n1290 g/L (20 °C)\n3630 g/L (100 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in ammonia\nalmost insoluble in nitric acid","Solubility in ethanol":"51.4 g/100 g (20 °C)\n62.9 g/100 g (40 °C)[1]","Solubility in methanol":"134 g/100 g (10 °C)\n144 g/100 g (40 °C)\n158 g/100 g (60 °C)[1]","Solubility in acetone":"16.8 g/kg (20 °C)[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"6.0","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-45.9·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic (anhydrous)\nmonoclinic (tetrahydrate)","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1037","R-phrases (outdated)":"R22, R41","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n3\nOX","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"302 mg/kg (rat, oral)","Other anions":"Calcium sulfate\nCalcium chloride","Other cations":"Magnesium nitrate\nStrontium nitrate\nBarium nitrate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
