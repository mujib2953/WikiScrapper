{"name":"Calcium hydride","desc":"Calcium hydride is the chemical compound with the formula CaH2, and is therefore an alkaline earth hydride. This grey powder (white if pure, which is rare) reacts vigorously with water liberating hydrogen gas. CaH2 is thus used as a drying agent, i.e. a desiccant.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium hydride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Calcium_Hydride_%28CaH2%29.jpg/200px-Calcium_Hydride_%28CaH2%29.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_hydride","IUPAC name":"Calcium hydride","Other names":"Calcium(II) hydride\nCalcium dihydride","CAS Number":"7789-78-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"94784 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.263","EC Number":"232-189-2","PubChem CID":"105052","Chemical formula":"CaH<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"42.094 g/mol","Appearance":"gray powder (white when pure)","Density":"1.70 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"816 °C (1,501 °F; 1,089 K)","Solubility in water":"reacts violently","Solubility":"reacts in alcohol","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP12","Space group":"Pnma, No. 62","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"41.4 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−181.5 kJ·mol−1","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-142.5 kJ/mol","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H260","Other cations":"Sodium hydride,\nPotassium hydride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
