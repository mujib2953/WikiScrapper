{"name":"Iodine","desc":"Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53. The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists as a lustrous, purple-black metallic solid at standard conditions that sublimes readily to form a violet gas. The elemental form was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811. It was named two years later by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac from this property, after the Greek ἰωδης \"violet-coloured\".","images":[{"alt":"Sample of iodine.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Sample_of_iodine.jpg/220px-Sample_of_iodine.jpg"},{"alt":"Hydrogen (diatomic nonmetal)","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Transparent.gif"}],"link":"/wiki/Iodine","":"","tellurium ← iodine → xenon":"‍","viewtalkeditreferencesin Wikidata":"view\ntalk\nedit"}
