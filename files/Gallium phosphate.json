{"name":"Gallium phosphate","desc":"Gallium phosphate (GaPO4 or gallium orthophosphate) is a colorless trigonal crystal with a hardness of 5.5 on the Mohs scale. GaPO4 is isotypic with quartz, possessing very similar properties, but the silicon atoms are alternately substituted with gallium and phosphorus, thereby doubling the piezoelectric effect. GaPO4 has many advantages over quartz for technical applications, like a higher electromechanical coupling coefficient in resonators, due to this doubling. Contrary to quartz, GaPO4 is not found in nature. Therefore, a hydrothermal process must be used to synthesize the crystal.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Gallium(III)_orthophosphate","Category":"crystal","Chemical formula (or Composition)":"GaPO4","Color":"Clear","Crystal system":"Trigonal","Crystal class":"32 or D3 (Sch√∂nflies)","Cleavage":"None","Fracture":"Conchoidal","Mohs Scale hardness":"5.5","Refractive index":"no=1.605, ne=1.623","Pleochroism":"None","Streak":"White","Density":"3570 kg/m<sup>3</sup>","Solubility":"insoluble in pH = 5 - 8"}
