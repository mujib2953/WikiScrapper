{"name":"Toluene","desc":"Toluene /ˈtɒljuːiːn/, also known as toluol /ˈtɒljuːɒl/, is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid with the smell associated with paint thinners. It is a mono-substituted benzene derivative, consisting of a CH3 group attached to a phenyl group. As such, its IUPAC systematic name is methylbenzene. It is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Toluene is predominantly used as an industrial feedstock and a solvent.<ref=Ullmann/>","images":[{"alt":"Toluol.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Toluol.svg/80px-Toluol.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Toluene","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Toluene[1]\nToluene[1]","Systematic IUPAC name":"Methylbenzene\nMethylbenzene","Other names":"Phenylmethane\nToluol\nAnisen","CAS Number":"108-88-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Abbreviations":"PhMe\nMePh\nBnH","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17578 N","ChemSpider":"1108 Y","DrugBank":"DB01900 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.297","IUPHAR/BPS":"5481","KEGG":"C01455 Y","PubChem CID":"1140","RTECS number":"XS5250000","UNII":"3FPU23BG52 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub>","Molar mass":"92.14 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid[2]","Odor":"sweet, pungent, benzene-like[3]","Density":"0.87 g/mL (20 &#xB0;C)<sup id=\"cite_ref-GESTIS_2-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GESTIS-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−95 °C (−139 °F; 178 K)[2]","Boiling point":"111 °C (232 °F; 384 K)[2]","Solubility in water":"0.52 g/L (20 °C)[2]","Vapor pressure":"2.8 kPa (20°C)[3]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-66.11·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.497 (20 °C)","Viscosity":"0.590 cP (20 °C)","Dipole moment":"0.36 D","Main hazards":"highly flammable","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nSIRI.org","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H225, H361d, H304, H373, H315, H336","GHS precautionary statements":"P210, P240, <abbr class=\"abbr\" title=\"Error in hazard statements\">P301+310+330, P302+352, P308+313, P314, P403+233","NFPA 704":"3\n2\n0","Flash point":"6 °C (43 °F; 279 K)[2]","Explosive limits":"1.1%-7.1%[3]","Threshold limit value":"50 mL m−3, 190 mg m−3","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":">26700 ppm (rat, 1 hr)\n400 ppm (mouse, 24 hr)[4]","LCLo (lowest published)":"55,000 ppm (rabbit, 40 min)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 200 ppm C 300 ppm 500 ppm (10-minute maximum peak)[3]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 100 ppm (375 mg/m3) ST 150 ppm (560 mg/m3)[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"500 ppm[3]","Related aromatic hydrocarbons":"benzene\nxylene\nnaphthalene","Related compounds":"methylcyclohexane","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
