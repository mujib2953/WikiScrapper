{"name":"Calcium perchlorate","desc":"Calcium perchlorate is classified as a metal perchlorate salt with the molecular formula Ca(ClO4)2. It is an inorganic compound that is a yellow-white crystalline solid in appearance. As a strong oxidizing agent, it reacts with reducing agents when heated to generate heat and products that may be gaseous (which will cause pressurization in closed containers). Calcium perchlorate has been categorized as having explosive reactivity. Ca(ClO4)2 is a common chemical on the soil of planet Mars, counting for almost 1% of the Martian dust, by weight.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium perchlorate.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Calcium_perchlorate.svg/200px-Calcium_perchlorate.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_perchlorate","IUPAC name":"Calcium perchlorate","Other names":"Calcium perchlorate tetrahydrate, Calcium diperchlorate, Perchloric acid calcium salt (2:1), Calcium perchlorate, hydrated","CAS Number":"13477-36-6","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"55537","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.411","PubChem CID":"61629","Chemical formula":"Ca(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"238.9792 g/mol","Appearance":"White to yellow crystalline solid","Density":"2.651 g/cm3","Melting point":"270 °C (518 °F; 543 K)","Solubility in water":"188 g/100mL (20 °C)","Solubility":"EtOH, MeOH","Main hazards":"Inhalation, ingestion or contact (skin, eyes) with vapors or substance may cause severe injury, burns, etc. Fire may produce irritating, corrosive and/or toxic gases.
