{"name":"Silver iodide","desc":"Silver iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula AgI. The compound is a bright yellow solid, but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a gray coloration. The silver contamination arises because AgI is highly photosensitive. This property is exploited in silver-based photography. Silver iodide is also used as an antiseptic and in cloud seeding.","images":[{"alt":"Jodid stříbrný.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Jodid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Jodid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"Silver iodide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Silver-iodide-3D-balls.png/200px-Silver-iodide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Silver_iodide","Other names":"Silver(I) iodide","CAS Number":"7783-96-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22969 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.125","EC Number":"232-038-0","PubChem CID":"6432717","UNII":"81M6Z3D1XE Y","Chemical formula":"AgI","Molar mass":"234.77 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow, crystalline solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"5.675 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"558 °C (1,036 °F; 831 K)","Boiling point":"1,506 °C (2,743 °F; 1,779 K)","Solubility in water":"3×10−7g/100mL (20 °C)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"8.52 × 10 −17","Solubility":"soluble in acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−80.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"hexagonal (β-phase, < 147 °C)\ncubic (α-phase, > 147 °C)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"115 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−62 kJ·mol−1[1]","Safety data sheet":"Sigma-Aldrich","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
