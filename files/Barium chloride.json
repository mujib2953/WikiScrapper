{"name":"Barium chloride","desc":"Barium chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula BaCl2. It is one of the most common water-soluble salts of barium. Like other barium salts, it is toxic and imparts a yellow-green coloration to a flame. It is also hygroscopic.","images":[{"alt":"Cotunnite structure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Cotunnite_structure.png/200px-Cotunnite_structure.png"},{"alt":"Barium chloride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Barium_chloride.jpg/200px-Barium_chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_chloride","[1]":"Barium muriate\nMuryate of Barytes[1]\nBarium dichloride","CAS Number":"10361-37-2 Y\n10326-27-9 (dihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23540 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.704","EC Number":"233-788-1","PubChem CID":"25204","RTECS number":"CQ8750000 (anhydrous)\nCQ8751000 (dihydrate)","UNII":"0VK51DA1T2 Y","Chemical formula":"BaCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"208.23 g/mol (anhydrous)\n244.26 g/mol (dihydrate)","Appearance":"White solid","Density":"3.856&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n3.0979&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)","Melting point":"962 °C (1,764 °F; 1,235 K) (960 °C, dihydrate)","Boiling point":"1,560 °C (2,840 °F; 1,830 K)","Solubility in water":"31.2 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n35.8 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n59.4 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in methanol, insoluble in ethanol, ethyl acetate[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-72.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"orthogonal (anhydrous)\nmonoclinic (dihydrate)","Coordination geometry":"7-9","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−858.56 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Toxic (T)\nHarmful (Xn)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20, R25","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"78 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n50 mg/kg (guinea pig, oral)[4]","LDLo (lowest published)":"112 mg Ba/kg (rabbit, oral)\n59 mg Ba/kg (dog, oral)\n46 mg Ba/kg (mouse, oral)[4]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[3]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"50 mg/m3[3]","Other anions":"Barium fluoride\nBarium bromide\nBarium iodide","Other cations":"Beryllium chloride\nMagnesium chloride\nCalcium chloride\nStrontium chloride\nRadium chloride\nLead chloride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
