{"name":"Aspartic acid","desc":"Aspartic acid (abbreviated as Asp or D; encoded by the codons [GAU and GAC]), also known as aspartate, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Similar to all other amino acids it contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its α-amino group is in the protonated –NH+\n3 form under physiological conditions, while its α-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated −COO− under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH2COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO− . It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed.","images":[{"alt":"Aspartic Acidph.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Aspartic_Acidph.png/200px-Aspartic_Acidph.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the L-aspartic acid molecule as a zwitterion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/L-Aspartic-acid-zwitterion-3D-balls.png/220px-L-Aspartic-acid-zwitterion-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Aspartic_acid","IUPAC names":"Trivial: Aspartic acid\nSystematic: 2-Aminobutanedioic acid","[1]":"Aminosuccinic acid, asparagic acid, asparaginic acid[1]","CAS Number":"617-45-8 Y\n56-84-8 (L-isomer) N\n1783-96-6 (D-isomer) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:22660 Y","ChemSpider":"411 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.265","EC Number":"200-291-6","KEGG":"C16433 Y","PubChem CID":"424","UNII":"28XF4669EP Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"133.10 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colourless crystals","Density":"1.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"270 °C (518 °F; 543 K)","Boiling point":"324 °C (615 °F; 597 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"4.5 g/L[2]","Acidity (pKa)":"3.9","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-64.2·10−6 cm3/mol","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","NFPA 704":"1\n1\n0","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
