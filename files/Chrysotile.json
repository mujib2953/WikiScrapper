{"name":"Chrysotile","desc":"Chrysotile or white asbestos is the most commonly encountered form of asbestos, accounting for approximately 95% of the asbestos in the United States and a similar proportion in other countries. It is a soft, fibrous silicate mineral in the serpentine subgroup of phyllosilicates; as such, it is distinct from other asbestiform minerals in the amphibole group. Its idealized chemical formula is Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4. The material has physical properties which make it desirable for inclusion in building materials, but poses serious health risks when dispersed into air and inhaled.","images":[{"alt":"Chrysotile 1.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Chrysotile_1.jpg/260px-Chrysotile_1.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Chrysotile"}
