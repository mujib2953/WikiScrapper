{"name":"Heavy water","desc":"Heavy water (deuterium oxide, 2H\n2O, D\n2O) is a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (2H or D, also known as heavy hydrogen), rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope (1H or H, also called protium) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal \"light water\".","images":[{"alt":"Spacefill model of heavy water","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Heavy-water-3D-vdW.svg/100px-Heavy-water-3D-vdW.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Heavy_water","IUPAC namecitation needed":"[2H]2-Water[citation needed]","[1][2]":"Deuterium oxide[1]\nWater-d2[2]\nDideuterium monoxide\n\n\n\n\nDeuterium oxide[1]\nWater-d2[2]\nDideuterium monoxide","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">D<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span>O</span>","Molar mass":"20.0276 g mol−1","Appearance":"Very pale blue, transparent liquid","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"1.107 g mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>","Melting point":"3.82 °C; 38.88 °F; 276.97 K","Boiling point":"101.4 °C (214.5 °F; 374.5 K)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","log P":"−1.38","Refractive index (nD)":"1.328","Viscosity":"1.25 mPa s (at 20 °C)","Dipole moment":"1.87 D","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n1","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
