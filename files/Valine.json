{"name":"Valine","desc":"Valine (abbreviated as Val or V) encoded by the codons GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isopropyl variable group, classifying it as a non-polar amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it and thus it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are any proteinaceous foods such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes.","images":[{"alt":"ValinenotatpH7.4.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/ValinenotatpH7.4.png/100px-ValinenotatpH7.4.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Valine","":"","IUPAC name":"Valine","Other names":"2-amino-3-methylbutanoic acid","CAS Number":"516-06-3 Y\n72-18-4 (L-isomer) Y\n640-68-6 (D-isomer) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:57762 Y","ChemSpider":"6050 Y","DrugBank":"DB00161 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.703","EC Number":"208-220-0","IUPHAR/BPS":"4794","KEGG":"D00039 Y","PubChem CID":"1182","UNII":"4CA13A832H Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>11</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"117.15 g·mol−1","Density":"1.316 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"298 °C (568 °F; 571 K) (decomposition)","Solubility in water":"soluble","Acidity (pKa)":"2.32 (carboxyl), 9.62 (amino)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-74.3·10−6 cm3/mol","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
