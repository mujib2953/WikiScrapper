{"name":"Magnesium oxalate","desc":"Magnesium oxalate is an inorganic compound comprising a magnesium cation with a 2+ charge bonded to an oxalate anion. It has the chemical formula MgC2O4. Magnesium oxalate is a white solid that comes in two forms: an anhydrous form and a dihydrate form where two water molecules are complexed with the structure. Both forms are practically insoluble in water and are insoluble in organic solutions.","images":[{"alt":"Magnesium oxalate.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Magnesium_oxalate.svg/200px-Magnesium_oxalate.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Magnesium_oxalate","IUPAC name":"magnesium oxalate","Systematic IUPAC name":"magnesium oxalate\nmagnesium oxalate","[1]":"magnesium ethanedioate\nethanedioic acid, magnesium salt (1:1)\n(Dihydrate)\nmagnesium oxalate-2-hydrate\nmagnesium oxalate dihydrate\noxalic acid magnesium salt dihydrate\n\n\n[1]\n\nmagnesium ethanedioate\nethanedioic acid, magnesium salt (1:1)\n(Dihydrate)\nmagnesium oxalate-2-hydrate\nmagnesium oxalate dihydrate\noxalic acid magnesium salt dihydrate","CAS Number":"547-66-0 [2]\n6150-88-5 (dihydrate)[2]","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"61648 [1]","ECHA InfoCard":"100.008.121","EC Number":"208-932-1[3]","PubChem CID":"68353 [1]","UN number":"2811 [4]","Chemical formula":"<div class=\"plainlist\">\n<ul>\n<li>MgC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></li>\n<li>MgC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&#x2022;2H<sub>2</sub>O (Dihydrate)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","Molar mass":"112.324 g/mol\n148.354 g/mol (Dihydrate)\n\n\n[2]","Appearance":"white solid [2]","Density":"2.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Source10_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Source10-5\">[5]</a></sup>","Melting point":"between 420 and 620 °C (788 and 1,148 °F; 693 and 893 K)\n150 °C (302 °F; 423 K) (dihydrate)  both decompose[7]","Boiling point":"Not Applicable","Solubility in water":"0.038g/100g H2O (anhydrous and dihydrate)[2]","Solubility":"insoluble in organics","Vapor pressure":"6996334639192411650♠2.51×10−6 mmHg[3]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-1269.0 kJ mol−1[2]","Main hazards":"Irritant","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Not Applicable","Autoignition\ntemperature":"Not Applicable","Related compounds":"Magnesium Oxide"}
