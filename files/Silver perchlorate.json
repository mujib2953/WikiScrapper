{"name":"Silver perchlorate","desc":"Silver perchlorate is the chemical compound with the formula AgClO4. This white solid forms a monohydrate and is mildly deliquescent. It is a useful source of the Ag+ ion, although the presence of perchlorate presents risks. It is used as a catalyst in organic chemistry.","images":[{"alt":"Silver perchlorate.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Silver_perchlorate.png/120px-Silver_perchlorate.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Silver_perchlorate","IUPAC name":"Silver perchlorate","Other names":"Perchloric acid, silver(1+) salt","CAS Number":"7783-93-9 Y\n14242-05-8 (hydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22968 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.123","EC Number":"232-035-4","PubChem CID":"24562","Chemical formula":"AgClO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"207.319 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless hygroscopic crystals","Density":"2.806 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"486 °C (907 °F; 759 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"557 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n792.8 g/100 mL (99 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in organic solvents","Crystal structure":"cubic","R-phrases (outdated)":"R8 R34 R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"S15 S17 S26 S36/37/39 S45","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n2\nOX","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
