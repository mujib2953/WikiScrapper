{"name":"Barium cyanide","desc":"Barium cyanide is a chemical compound with the formula Ba(CN)2. It is synthesized by the reaction of hydrogen cyanide and barium hydroxide in water or petroleum ether. This white crystal reacts with water and carbon dioxide in air slowly, producing highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas.","images":[{"alt":"Barium cyanide structure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Barium_cyanide_structure.svg/200px-Barium_cyanide_structure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Barium_cyanide","IUPAC name":"Barium dicyanide","CAS Number":"542-62-1","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"10496","ECHA InfoCard":"100.008.021","EC Number":"208-882-3","PubChem CID":"10961","Chemical formula":"Ba(CN)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"189.362 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystal","Melting point":"600 °C (1,112 °F; 873 K)","Solubility in water":"18 g/100 mL (14 °C)","Solubility":"Soluble in ethanol"}
