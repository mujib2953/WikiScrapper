{"name":"Gold(III) chloride","desc":"Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine. With the molecular formula Au2Cl6, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl3. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). Chloroauric acid, HAuCl4, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as \"gold chloride\" or \"acid gold trichloride\". Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol. It decomposes above 160 °C or in light.","images":[{"alt":"AuCl3 structure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/AuCl3_structure.svg/220px-AuCl3_structure.svg.png"},{"alt":"Gold(III)-chloride-dimer-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Gold%28III%29-chloride-dimer-3D-balls.png/220px-Gold%28III%29-chloride-dimer-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Gold(III)-chloride-xtal-3D-SF-B.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Gold%28III%29-chloride-xtal-3D-SF-B.png/220px-Gold%28III%29-chloride-xtal-3D-SF-B.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Gold_trichloride","IUPAC name":"Gold(III) trichloride","Other names":"Auric chloride\nGold trichloride","CAS Number":"13453-07-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30076 Y","ChemSpider":"24244 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.033.280","PubChem CID":"26030","RTECS number":"MD5420000","UNII":"15443PR153 Y","Chemical formula":"AuCl<sub>3</sub><br>\n(exists as Au<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>)","Molar mass":"303.325 g/mol","Appearance":"Red crystals (anhydrous); golden, yellow crystals (monohydrate)[1]","Density":"4.7&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"254 °C (489 °F; 527 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"68 g/100 ml (cold)","Solubility":"soluble in ether, slightly soluble in liquid ammonia","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−112·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"monoclinic","Coordination geometry":"Square planar","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","R-phrases (outdated)":"R36/37/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26 S36","Other anions":"Gold(III) fluoride\nGold(III) bromide","Other cations":"Gold(I) chloride\nSilver(I) chloride\nPlatinum(II) chloride\nMercury(II) chloride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
