{"name":"Calcium formate","desc":"Calcium formate, Ca(HCO2)2 (or. Ca(HCOO)2), is the calcium salt of formic acid, HCOOH. It is also known as food additive E238 in food industry. The mineral form is very rare and called formicaite. It is known from a few boron deposits. It may be produced synthetically by reacting calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide with formic acid.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium formate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Calcium_formate_structure.png/200px-Calcium_formate_structure.png"},{"alt":"Calcium diformate ball-and-stick.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Calcium_diformate_ball-and-stick.png/200px-Calcium_diformate_ball-and-stick.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_formate","Systematic IUPAC name":"Calcium methanoate\nCalcium methanoate","Other names":"formic acid calcium salt, calcoform","CAS Number":"544-17-2 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"10531 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.008.058","EC Number":"208-863-7","E number":"E238 (preservatives)","KEGG":"C18586 Y","PubChem CID":"10997","RTECS number":"LQ5600000","Chemical formula":"Ca(HCO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"130.113 g/mol","Appearance":"white powder","Odor":"weak, caramel-like odor","Density":"2.009 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"decomposes at 300 °C","Solubility in water":"16.1 g/100 ml (0 °C)\n16.6 g/100 ml (20 °C)\n18.4 g/100 ml (100 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in alcohol","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Other anions":"Calcium acetate","Other cations":"Sodium formate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
