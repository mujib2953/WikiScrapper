{"name":"Limonite","desc":"Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)Â·nH2O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE.","images":[{"alt":"LimoniteUSGOV.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/LimoniteUSGOV.jpg/260px-LimoniteUSGOV.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Limonite"}
