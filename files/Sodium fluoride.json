{"name":"Sodium fluoride","desc":"Sodium fluoride (NaF) is a chemical compound and medication. As a medication it is primarily used to prevent tooth decay in children older than 6 months in areas where the drinking water is low in fluoride. Sodium fluoride is used as a liquid, pill, or paste by mouth with this use being known as fluoride therapy.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Sodium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png/200px-Sodium-fluoride-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_fluoride","Pronunciation":"/ˌsoʊdiəm ˈflʊəraɪd/[1]","IUPAC name":"Sodium fluoride","Other names":"Florocid","CAS Number":"7681-49-4 Y","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28741 Y","ChemSpider":"5045 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.789","EC Number":"231-667-8","KEGG":"C08142 N","PubChem CID":"5235","RTECS number":"WB0350000","UNII":"8ZYQ1474W7 Y","UN number":"1690","Chemical formula":"NaF","Molar mass":"41.988173 g/mol","Appearance":"White to greenish solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.558 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"993 °C (1,819 °F; 1,266 K)","Boiling point":"1,704 °C (3,099 °F; 1,977 K)","Solubility in water":"36.4 g/L (0 °C);\n40.4 g/L (20 °C);\n50.5 g/L (100 °C)[2]","Solubility":"slightly soluble in HF, ammonia\nnegligible in alcohol, acetone, SO2, dimethylformamide","Vapor pressure":"1 mmHg @ 1077 C°[3]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−16.4·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.3252","Crystal structure":"Cubic","Lattice constant":"a = 462 pm","Molecular shape":"Octahedral","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"46.82 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"51.3 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-573.6 kJ/mol","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-543.3 kJ/mol","ATC code":"A01AA01 (WHO) A12CD01 (WHO),\nV09IX06 (WHO) (18F)","Safety data sheet":"[4]","GHS hazard statements":"H301, H315, H319[4]","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"52–200 mg/kg (oral in rats, mice, rabbits)[6]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 2.5 mg/m3[5]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 2.5 mg/m3[5]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"250 mg/m3 (as F)[5]","Other anions":"Sodium chloride\nSodium bromide\nSodium iodide\nSodium astatide","Other cations":"Lithium fluoride\nPotassium fluoride\nRubidium fluoride\nCaesium fluoride\nFrancium fluoride","Related compounds":"TASF reagent","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
