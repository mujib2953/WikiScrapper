{"name":"Sodium hydride","desc":"Sodium hydride is the chemical compound with the empirical formula NaH. This alkali metal hydride is primarily used as a strong, yet combustible base in organic synthesis. NaH is representative of the saline hydrides, meaning it is a salt-like hydride, composed of Na+ and H− ions, in contrast to the more molecular hydrides such as borane, methane, ammonia and water. It is an ionic material that is insoluble in organic solvents (although soluble in molten Na), consistent with the fact that H− remains an unknown anion in solution. Because of the insolubility of NaH, all reactions involving NaH occur at the surface of the solid.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium hydride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/NaH.jpg/200px-NaH.jpg"},{"alt":"Sodium-hydride-3D-vdW.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Sodium-hydride-3D-vdW.png/200px-Sodium-hydride-3D-vdW.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_hydride","CAS Number":"7646-69-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23144 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.716","EC Number":"231-587-3","PubChem CID":"24758","Chemical formula":"NaH","Molar mass":"23.99771 g/mol","Appearance":"white or grey solid","Density":"1.396 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"300 °C (572 °F; 573 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"Reacts with water","Solubility":"insoluble in ammonia, benzene, CCl4, CS2","Refractive index (nD)":"1.470","Crystal structure":"fcc (NaCl), cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Lattice constant":"a = 498 pm","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (Na+)\nOctahedral (H−)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"36.4 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"40 J·mol−1·K−1[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−56.4 kJ·mol−1[1]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-33.5 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H260","NFPA 704":"3\n3\n2\nW","Flash point":"combustible","Other cations":"Lithium hydride\nPotassium hydride","Related compounds":"Sodium borohydride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
