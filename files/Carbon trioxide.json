{"name":"Carbon trioxide","desc":"Carbon trioxide (CO3) is an unstable oxide of carbon (an oxocarbon). Three possible isomers of carbon trioxide, with molecular symmetry point groups Cs, D3h, and C2v, have been most studied by theoretical methods, and the C2v state has been shown to be the ground state of the molecule.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Carbon_trioxide"}
