{"name":"Adenine","desc":"Adenine /ˈædᵻnᵻn/ (A, Ade) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative). Its derivatives have a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration, in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). It also has functions in protein synthesis and as a chemical component of DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA.","images":[{"alt":"Adenine.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Adenine.svg/120px-Adenine.svg.png"},{"alt":"Adenine-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Adenine-3D-balls.png/100px-Adenine-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Adenine","":"","IUPAC name":"9H-purin-6-amine","Other names":"6-aminopurine","CAS Number":"73-24-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16708 Y","ChemSpider":"185 Y","DrugBank":"DB00173 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.724","EC Number":"200-796-1","IUPHAR/BPS":"4788","KEGG":"D00034 Y","PubChem CID":"190","RTECS number":"AU6125000","UNII":"JAC85A2161 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>5</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"135.13 g/mol","Appearance":"white to light yellow, crystalline","Density":"1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (calculated)","Melting point":"360 to 365 °C (680 to 689 °F; 633 to 638 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"0.103 g/100 mL","Solubility":"negligible in ethanol","Acidity (pKa)":"4.15 (secondary), 9.80 (primary)[1]","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"147.0 J/(K·mol)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"96.9 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"MSDS","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"227 mg/kg (rat, oral)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
