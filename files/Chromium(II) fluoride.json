{"name":"Chromium(II) fluoride","desc":"Chromium(II) fluoride is an inorganic compound with the formula CrF2. It exists as a blue-green iridescent solid. Chromium(II) fluoride is sparingly soluble in water, almost insoluble in alcohol, and is soluble in boiling hydrochloric acid, but is not attacked by hot distilled sulfuric acid or nitric acid. Like other chromous compounds, chromium(II) fluoride is oxidized to chromium(III) oxide in air.","images":[{"alt":"Rutile structure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Rutile_structure.png/200px-Rutile_structure.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Chromium(II)_fluoride","Other names":"chromium difluoride, chromium fluouride, chromous fluoride","CAS Number":"10049-10-2","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"59614","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.140","EC Number":"233-168-0","PubChem CID":"66229","UNII":"53XZY98IXY Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Chromium\">Cr</span><span title=\"Fluorine\">F</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"89.99 g·mol−1","Appearance":"blue-green iridescent crystals[1]\nhygroscopic, turns to Cr2O3 when heated in air[1]","Density":"3.79 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Handbook_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Handbook-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"894 °C (1,641 °F; 1,167 K)[1]","Boiling point":"> 1,300 °C (2,370 °F; 1,570 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"76.7 g/100 mL","Crystal structure":"monoclinic[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-8.645 kJ/g (solid)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Xn  C","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/21/22, R31, R34","S-phrases (outdated)":"S25, S26, S27/28, S36/37/39, S45"}
