{"name":"Borazine","desc":"Borazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (BH)3(NH)3. In this cyclic compound, the three BH units and three NH units alternate. The compound is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene. Like benzene, borazine is a colourless liquid. For this reason borazine is sometimes referred to as \"inorganic benzene\".","images":[{"alt":"Borazine-dimensions-2D.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Borazine-dimensions-2D.png/200px-Borazine-dimensions-2D.png"},{"alt":"Borazine-elpot-3D-vdW.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Borazine-elpot-3D-vdW.png/100px-Borazine-elpot-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Borazine","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"1,3,5,2,4,6-Triazatriborinane (only preselected[1])\n1,3,5,2,4,6-Triazatriborinane (only preselected[1])","Other names":"Borazine\nCyclotriborazaneborazol\nInorganic benzene\nBorazole","CAS Number":"6569-51-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33119 Y","ChemSpider":"122374 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.169.303","PubChem CID":"138768","Chemical formula":"B<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"80.50 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Density":"0.81&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−58 °C (−72 °F; 215 K)","Boiling point":"53 °C (127 °F; 326 K) (55 °C at 105 Pa)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-49.6·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"2\n2\n1","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
