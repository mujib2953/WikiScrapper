{"name":"Magnesium sulfate","desc":"Magnesium sulfate is an inorganic salt (chemical compound) containing magnesium, sulfur and oxygen, with the formula MgSO4. It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O), commonly called Epsom salt. The monohydrate, MgSO4·H2O is found as the mineral kieserite. The overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority was used in agriculture.","images":[{"alt":"Magnesium sulfate anhydrous.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Magnesium_sulfate_anhydrous.jpg/200px-Magnesium_sulfate_anhydrous.jpg"},{"alt":"Magnesium sulfate.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Magnesium_sulfate.JPG/200px-Magnesium_sulfate.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate","IUPAC name":"Magnesium sulfate","Other names":"Epsom salt (heptahydrate)\nEnglish salt\nBitter salts\nBath salts","CAS Number":"7487-88-9 Y\n14168-73-1 (monohydrate) Y\n24378-31-2 (tetrahydrate) Y\n15553-21-6 (pentahydrate) Y\n13778-97-7 (hexahydrate) Y\n10034-99-8 (heptahydrate) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:32599 Y","ChemSpider":"22515 Y","DrugBank":"DB00653 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.453","E number":"E518 (acidity regulators, ...)","PubChem CID":"24083","RTECS number":"OM4500000","UNII":"ML30MJ2U7I Y","Chemical formula":"MgSO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"120.366 g/mol (anhydrous)\n138.38 g/mol (monohydrate)\n174.41 g/mol (trihydrate)\n210.44 g/mol (pentahydrate)\n228.46 g/mol (hexahydrate)\n246.47 g/mol (heptahydrate)","Appearance":"white crystalline solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.66 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.445 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (monohydrate)<br>\n1.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (heptahydrate)<br>\n1.512 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (11-hydrate)","Melting point":"anhydrous decomposes at 1,124°C\nmonohydrate decomposes at 200°C\nheptahydrate decomposes at 150°C\nundecahydrate decomposes at 2°C","Solubility in water":"anhydrous\n26.9 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n35.1 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n50.2 g/100 mL (100 °C)\n\nheptahydrate\n113 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Solubility":"1.16 g/100 mL (18°C, ether)\nslightly soluble in alcohol, glycerol\ninsoluble in acetone","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−50·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.523 (monohydrate)\n1.433 (heptahydrate)","Crystal structure":"monoclinic (hydrate)","ATC code":"A06AD04 (WHO) A12CC02 (WHO) B05XA05 (WHO) D11AX05 (WHO) V04CC02 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Other cations":"Beryllium sulfate\nCalcium sulfate\nStrontium sulfate\nBarium sulfate","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
