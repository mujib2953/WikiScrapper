{"name":"Coenzyme A","desc":"Coenzyme A (CoA, CoASH, or HSCoA) is a coenzyme, notable for its role in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids, and the oxidation of pyruvate in the citric acid cycle. All genomes sequenced to date encode enzymes that use coenzyme A as a substrate, and around 4% of cellular enzymes use it (or a thioester, such as acetyl-CoA) as a substrate. In humans, CoA biosynthesis requires cysteine, pantothenate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).","images":[{"alt":"Coenzym A.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Coenzym_A.svg/350px-Coenzym_A.svg.png"},{"alt":"Coenzyme-A-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Coenzyme-A-3D-balls.png/350px-Coenzyme-A-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Coenzyme_A","CAS Number":"85-61-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:15346 N","ChemSpider":"6557 Y","DrugBank":"DB01992 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.001.472","KEGG":"C00010 Y","MeSH":"Coenzyme+A","PubChem CID":"6816","UNII":"SAA04E81UX Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>36</sub>N<sub>7</sub>O<sub>16</sub>P<sub>3</sub>S","Molar mass":"767.535","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
