{"name":"Salicylic acid","desc":"Salicylic acid (from Latin salix, willow tree) is a lipophilic monohydroxybenzoic acid, a type of phenolic acid, and a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). It has the formula C7H6O3. This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It is derived from the metabolism of salicin. In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products. The salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates. The medicinal part of the willow tree is the inner bark.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of salicylic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Salicylic-acid-skeletal.svg/100px-Salicylic-acid-skeletal.svg.png"},{"alt":"Salicylic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Kwas_salicylowy.jpg/200px-Kwas_salicylowy.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Salicylic_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"2-Hydroxybenzoic acid[1]\n2-Hydroxybenzoic acid[1]","CAS Number":"69-72-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16914 Y","ChemSpider":"331 Y","DrugBank":"DB00936 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.648","EC Number":"200-712-3","IUPHAR/BPS":"4306","KEGG":"D00097 Y","PubChem CID":"338","RTECS number":"VO0525000","UNII":"O414PZ4LPZ Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"138.12 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless to white crystals","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.443 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 &#xB0;C)<sup id=\"cite_ref-crc_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-crc-2\">[2]</a></sup>","Melting point":"158.6 °C (317.5 °F; 431.8 K)","Boiling point":"200 °C (392 °F; 473 K)\ndecomposes[3]\n211 °C (412 °F; 484 K)\nat 20 mmHg[2]","Sublimation\nconditions":"sublimes at 76 °C[4]","Solubility in water":"1.24 g/L (0 °C)\n2.48 g/L (25 °C)\n4.14 g/L (40 °C)\n17.41 g/L (75 °C)[3]\n77.79 g/L (100 °C)[5]","Solubility":"soluble in ether, CCl4, benzene, propanol, acetone, ethanol, oil of turpentine, toluene","Solubility in benzene":"0.46 g/100 g (11.7 °C)\n0.775 g/100 g (25 °C)\n0.991 g/100 g (30.5 °C)\n2.38 g/100 g (49.4 °C)\n4.4 g/100 g (64.2 °C)[3][5]","Solubility in chloroform":"2.22 g/100 mL (25 °C)[5]\n2.31 g/100 mL (30.5 °C)[3]","Solubility in methanol":"40.67 g/100 g (−3 °C)\n62.48 g/100 g (21 °C)[3]","Solubility in olive oil":"2.43 g/100 g (23 °C)[3]","Solubility in acetone":"39.6 g/100 g (23 °C)[3]","log P":"2.26","Vapor pressure":"10.93 mPa[4]","Acidity (pKa)":"1 = 2.97 (25 °C)[6]\n2 = 13.82 (20 °C)[3]","UV-vis (λmax)":"210 nm, 234 nm, 303 nm (4 mg % in ethanol)[4]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-72.23·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.565 (20 °C)[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-589.9 kJ/mol","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"3.025 MJ/mol[7]","ATC code":"A01AD05 (WHO) B01AC06 (WHO) D01AE12 (WHO) N02BA01 (WHO) S01BC08 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"MSDS","GHS pictograms":"[8]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H302, H318[8]","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P305+351+338[8]","Eye hazard":"Severe irritation","Skin hazard":"Mild irritation","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n0","Flash point":"157 °C (315 °F; 430 K)\nclosed cup[4]","Autoignition\ntemperature":"540 °C (1,004 °F; 813 K)[4]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"480 mg/kg (mice, oral)","Related compounds":"Methyl salicylate,\nBenzoic acid,\nPhenol, Aspirin,\n4-Hydroxybenzoic acid,\nMagnesium salicylate,\nCholine salicylate,\nBismuth subsalicylate,\nSulfosalicylic acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
