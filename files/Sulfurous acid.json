{"name":"Sulfurous acid","desc":"Sulfurous acid (also sulphurous acid) is the chemical compound with the formula H2SO3. There is no evidence that sulfurous acid exists in solution, but the molecule has been detected in the gas phase. The conjugate bases of this elusive acid are, however, common anions, bisulfite (or hydrogen sulfite) and sulfite. Sulfurous acid is an intermediate species in the formation of acid rain from sulfur dioxide.","images":[{"alt":"Sulfurous acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Sulfurous-acid-2D-pyramidal.png/150px-Sulfurous-acid-2D-pyramidal.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of sulfurous acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Sulfurous-acid-3D-balls.png/200px-Sulfurous-acid-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sulfurous_acid","IUPAC name":"Sulfurous acid","CAS Number":"7782-99-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:48854 Y","ChemSpider":"1069 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.066","KEGG":"C00094 Y","PubChem CID":"1100","UNII":"J1P7893F4J Y","Chemical formula":"H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"82.07 g/mol","Acidity (pKa)":"1.857, 7.172","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0074","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"C (C)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20, R34","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S9, S26, S36/37/39, S45","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Related compounds":"Sulfur dioxide\nSulfuric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
