{"name":"Hydronium","desc":"In chemistry, hydronium is the common name for the aqueous cation H\n3O+, the type of oxonium ion produced by protonation of water. It is the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H+) to the surrounding water molecules (H2O).","images":[{"alt":"3D diagram showing the pyramidal structure of the hydroxonium ion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Hydroxonium-cation.svg/100px-Hydroxonium-cation.svg.png"},{"alt":"3D electric potential surface of the hydroxonium cation","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Hydroxonium-3D-elpot.png/100px-Hydroxonium-3D-elpot.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydronium","":"","IUPAC name":"oxonium","Other names":"hydronium ion","CAS Number":"13968-08-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29412 N","ChemSpider":"109935 N","PubChem CID":"123332","Chemical formula":"<a href=\"/wiki/Hydrogen\" title=\"Hydrogen\">H</a><sub>3</sub><a href=\"/wiki/Oxygen\" title=\"Oxygen\">O</a><sup>+</sup>","Molar mass":"19.02 g/mol","Acidity (pKa)":"0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
