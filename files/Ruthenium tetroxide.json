{"name":"Ruthenium tetroxide","desc":"Ruthenium tetroxide (Ruthenium(VIII) oxide) is the inorganic compound with the formula RuO4. It is a colourless, diamagnetic liquid, but samples are typically black due to impurities. It is volatile. The analogous OsO4 is more widely used and better known. One of the few solvents in which it forms stable solutions is CCl4.","images":[{"alt":"Ruthenium tetroxide.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Ruthenium_tetroxide.svg/100px-Ruthenium_tetroxide.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ruthenium_tetroxide","":"","IUPAC name":"Ruthenium(VIII) oxide","CAS Number":"20427-56-9 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.815","PubChem CID":"119079","Chemical formula":"RuO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"165.07 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless liquid","Odor":"pungent","Density":"3.29 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"25.4 °C (77.7 °F; 298.5 K)","Boiling point":"40.0 °C (104.0 °F; 313.1 K)","Solubility in water":"2% w/v at 20 °C","Solubility in other solvents":"Soluble in\nCarbon tetrachloride\nChloroform","Molecular shape":"tetrahedral","Dipole moment":"zero","Safety data sheet":"external MSDS sheet","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Related compounds":"RuO2\nRuCl3","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
