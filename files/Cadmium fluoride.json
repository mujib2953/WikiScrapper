{"name":"Cadmium fluoride","desc":"Cadmium fluoride (CdF2) is a mostly water-insoluble source of cadmium used in oxygen-sensitive applications, such as the production of metallic alloys. In extremely low concentrations (ppm), this and other fluoride compounds are used in limited medical treatment protocols. Fluoride compounds also have significant uses in synthetic organic chemistry. The standard enthalpy has been found to be -167.39 kcal. mole−1 and the Gibbs energy of formation has been found to be -155.4 kcal. mole−1, and the heat of sublimation was determined to be 76 kcal. mole−1.","images":[{"alt":"Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png/200px-Fluorite-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Cadmium fluoride","Other names":"Cadmium(II) fluoride, Cadmium difluoride","CAS Number":"7790-79-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23036 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.293","EC Number":"232-222-0","Chemical formula":"CdF<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"150.41 g/mol","Appearance":"grey or white-grey crystals","Density":"6.33 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"1,110 °C (2,030 °F; 1,380 K)","Boiling point":"1,748 °C (3,178 °F; 2,021 K)","Solubility in water":"4.35 g/100 mL","Solubility":"soluble in acid\ninsoluble in ethanol alcohol and liquid ammonia","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-40.6·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Fluorite (cubic), cF12","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-167.39 ± 0.23 kcal. mole-1 at 298.15 (K, C?)","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-155.4 ± 0.3 kcal. mole-1 at 298.15 (K, C?)","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Carc.
