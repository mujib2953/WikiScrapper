{"name":"Zinc pyrophosphate","desc":"Zinc pyrophospate (Zn2P2O7) is an ionic inorganic chemical compound composed of Zn2+ cations and pyrophosphate anions. It is useful in gravimetric analysis of zinc. Zinc pyrophosphate is obtained by precipitating zinc as a phosphate, then heating over 1123 K.[citation needed]","images":[{"alt":"Zinc pyrophosphate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Zinc_pyrophosphate.png/200px-Zinc_pyrophosphate.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_pyrophosphate","Other names":"Dizinc diphosphate","CAS Number":"7446-26-6 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"56393 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.367","PubChem CID":"62641","Chemical formula":"Zn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>","Molar mass":"304.72 g/mol","Appearance":"White crystalline powder","Density":"3.75 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Solubility":"Soluble in dilute acids","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
