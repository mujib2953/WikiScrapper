{"name":"Ammonium chloride","desc":"Ammonium chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula NH4Cl and a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. Sal ammoniac is a name of the natural, mineralogical form of ammonium chloride. The mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps from condensation of coal-derived gases. It is also found around some types of volcanic vents. It is mainly used as fertilizer and a flavouring agent in some types of liquorice. It is the product from the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia.","images":[{"alt":"Unit cell of ammonium chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/NH4Cl.png/150px-NH4Cl.png"},{"alt":"Powder of ammonium chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Ammonium_chloride.jpg/200px-Ammonium_chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_chloride","IUPAC name":"Ammonium chloride","Other names":"Sal ammoniac, Salmiac, Nushadir salt, Sal armagnac, Salt armoniack","CAS Number":"12125-02-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:31206 Y","ChemSpider":"23807 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.976","EC Number":"235-186-4","KEGG":"D01139 Y","RTECS number":"BP4550000","UNII":"01Q9PC255D Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Chlorine\">Cl</span><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span>","Molar mass":"53.49 g·mol−1","Appearance":"White solid, hygroscopic","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"1.5274 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-pphoic_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-pphoic-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"338 °C (640 °F; 611 K) decomposes, sublimes","Boiling point":"520 °C (968 °F; 793 K)","Sublimation\nconditions":"Sublimes at 337.6 °C[2]\nΔsublHo = 176.1 kJ/mol[3]","Solubility in water":"244 g/L (−15 °C)\n294 g/L (0 °C)\n383.0 g/L (25 °C)\n454.4 g/L (40 °C)\n740.8 g/L (100 °C)[4]","Solubility product (Ksp)":"30.9 (395 g/L)[5]","Solubility":"Soluble in liquid ammonia, hydrazine, alcohol, methanol, glycerol\nSlightly soluble in acetone\nInsoluble in diethyl ether, ethyl acetate[2]","Solubility in methanol":"3.2 g/100 g (17 °C)\n3.35 g/100 g (19 °C)\n3.54 g/100 g (25 °C)[2]","Solubility in ethanol":"6 g/L (19 °C)[1]","Solubility in glycerol":"97 g/kg[2]","Solubility in sulfur dioxide":"0.09 g/kg (0 °C)\n0.031 g/kg (25 °C)[2]","Solubility in acetic acid":"0.67 g/kg (16.6 °C)[2]","Vapor pressure":"133.3 Pa (160.4 °C)[6]\n6.5 kPa (250 °C)\n33.5 kPa (300 °C)[1]","Acidity (pKa)":"9.24","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-36.7·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.642 (20 °C)[2]","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"84.1 J/mol·K[1]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"94.56 J/mol·K[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−314.43 kJ/mol[1]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"−202.97 kJ/mol[1]","ATC code":"B05XA04 (WHO) G04BA01 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1051","GHS pictograms":"[6]","GHS signal word":"Warning","GHS hazard statements":"H302, H319[6]","GHS precautionary statements":"P305+351+338[6]","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1650 mg/kg (rats, oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[7]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 10 mg/m3 ST 20 mg/m3 (as fume)[7]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[7]","Other anions":"Ammonium fluoride\nAmmonium bromide\nAmmonium iodide","Other cations":"Sodium chloride\nPotassium chloride\nHydroxylammonium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
