{"name":"Genistein","desc":"Genistein is an isoflavone that is described as an angiogenesis inhibitor and a phytoestrogen. It was first isolated in 1899 from the dyer's broom, Genista tinctoria; hence, the chemical name. The compound structure was established in 1926, when it was found to be identical with that of prunetol. It was chemically synthesized in 1928.","images":[{"alt":"Genistein.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Genistein.svg/220px-Genistein.svg.png"},{"alt":"Genistein molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Genistein-3D-balls.png/220px-Genistein-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Genistein","IUPAC name":"5,7-Dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromen-4-one","Other names":"4',5,7-Trihydroxyisoflavone","CAS Number":"446-72-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28088 Y","ChemSpider":"4444448 Y","DrugBank":"DB01645 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.006.524","IUPHAR/BPS":"2826","KEGG":"C06563 Y","PubChem CID":"5280961","UNII":"DH2M523P0H Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>15</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>10</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"270.24 g·mol−1","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
