{"name":"Sodium hydrosulfide","desc":"Sodium hydrosulfide is the chemical compound with the formula NaHS. This compound is the product of the half neutralization of hydrogen sulfide with sodium hydroxide. NaHS is a useful reagent for the synthesis of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds, sometimes as a solid reagent, and more often as an aqueous solution. Solid NaHS is colorless and typically smells like H2S due to hydrolysis by atmospheric moisture. In contrast with sodium sulfide, Na2S, which is insoluble in organic solvents, NaHS, being a 1:1 electrolyte, is more soluble. Alternatively, in place of NaHS, H2S can be treated with an organic amine to generate an ammonium salt. Solutions of HS− are sensitive to oxygen, converting mainly to polysulfides, indicated by the appearance of yellow.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium-hydrosulfide-LT-xtal-1991-CM-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Sodium-hydrosulfide-LT-xtal-1991-CM-3D-balls.png/250px-Sodium-hydrosulfide-LT-xtal-1991-CM-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_hydrosulfide","IUPAC name":"Sodium hydrosulfide","Other names":"Sodium bisulfide\nSodium sulfhydrate\nSodium hydrogen sulfide","CAS Number":"16721-80-5 Y\n207683-19-0 (hydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"26058 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.037.056","EC Number":"240-778-0","IUPHAR/BPS":"6278","PubChem CID":"28015","RTECS number":"WE1900000","UNII":"FWU2KQ177W Y","Chemical formula":"NaHS","Molar mass":"56.063 g/mol","Appearance":"off-white solid, deliquescent","Density":"1.79 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"350 °C (662 °F; 623 K) (anhydrous)\n55 °C (dihydrate)\n22 °C (trihydrate)","Solubility in water":"50 g/100 mL (22 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ether","Crystal structure":"rhombohedral","Main hazards":"Flammable solid, stench, releases hydrogen sulfide","Safety data sheet":"TDC MSDS","R-phrases (outdated)":"R17 R23 R24 R25","NFPA 704":"2\n3","Flash point":"90 °C (194 °F; 363 K)","Other anions":"Sodium hydroxide\nSodium amide","Other cations":"Ammonium hydrosulfide","Related compounds":"Sodium sulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
