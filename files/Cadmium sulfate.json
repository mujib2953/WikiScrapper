{"name":"Cadmium sulfate","desc":"Cadmium sulfate is the name of a series of related inorganic compounds with the formula CdSO4·xH2O. The most common form is the monohydrate CdSO4·H2O, but two other forms are known CdSO4·8/3H2O and the anhydrous salt (CdSO4). All salts are colourless and highly soluble in water.","images":[{"alt":"Cadmium sulfate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/CdSO4%28H2O%29.jpg/200px-CdSO4%28H2O%29.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_sulfate","IUPAC name":"Cadmium(II) sulfate","Niedermayrite":"Sulfuric acid, cadmium salt (1:1),\nNiedermayrite","CAS Number":"10124-36-4 Y\n7709-84-3 (monohydrate) N\n15244-35-9 (octahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:50292 Y","ChemSpider":"23335 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.288","EC Number":"233-331-6","RTECS number":"EV2700000","UNII":"947UNF3Z6O Y","UN number":"2570","Chemical formula":"CdSO<sub>4</sub><br>\nCdSO<sub>4</sub>&#xB7;H<sub>2</sub>O (monohydrate)<br>\n3CdSO<sub>4</sub>&#xB7;8H<sub>2</sub>O (octahydrate)","Molar mass":"208.47 g/mol (anhydrous)\n226.490 g/mol (monohydrate)\n769.546 g/mol (octahydrate)","Appearance":"White hygroscopic solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"4.691 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n3.79 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (monohydrate)<br>\n3.08 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (octahydrate)<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"1,000 °C (1,830 °F; 1,270 K) (anhydrous)\n105 °C (monohydrate)\n40 °C (octahydrate)","Boiling point":"(decomposes to basic sulfate and then oxide)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous:\n75 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n76.4 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n58.4 g/100 mL (99 °C)\n\nmonohydrate:\n76.7 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n\noctahydrate:\nvery soluble","Solubility":"slightly soluble in methanol, ethyl acetate\ninsoluble in ethanol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-59.2·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.565","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic (anhydrous)\nmonoclinic (hepta & octahydrate)","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"123 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−935 kJ·mol−1[2]","Safety data sheet":"[1]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Carc.
