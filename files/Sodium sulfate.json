{"name":"Sodium sulfate","desc":"Sodium sulfate, also known as sulfate of soda, is the inorganic compound with formula Na2SO4 as well as several related hydrates. All forms are white solids that are highly soluble in water. With an annual production of 6 million tonnes, the decahydrate is a major commodity chemical product. It is mainly used for the manufacture of detergents and in the kraft process of paper pulping.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium sulfate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Sodium_sulfate.jpg/100px-Sodium_sulfate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_sulfate","":"","ThenarditeMirabilite":"Thenardite (mineral)\nGlauber's salt (decahydrate)\nSal mirabilis (decahydrate)\nMirabilite (decahydrate)\nDisodium sulfate","CAS Number":"7757-82-6 Y\n7727-73-3 (decahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:32149 Y","ChemSpider":"22844 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.928","E number":"E514 (acidity regulators, ...)","PubChem CID":"24436","RTECS number":"WE1650000","UNII":"36KCS0R750 Y","Chemical formula":"Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"142.04 g/mol (anhydrous)\n322.20 g/mol (decahydrate)","Appearance":"white crystalline solid\nhygroscopic","Odor":"odorless","Density":"2.664 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.464&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (decahydrate)","Melting point":"884 °C (1,623 °F; 1,157 K) (anhydrous)\n32.38 °C (decahydrate)","Boiling point":"1,429 °C (2,604 °F; 1,702 K) (anhydrous)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous:\n4.76 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n13.9 g/100 mL (20 °C)[1]\n42.7 g/100 mL (100 °C)\n\nheptahydrate:\n19.5 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n44 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Solubility":"insoluble in ethanol\nsoluble in glycerol, water and hydrogen iodide","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−52.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.468 (anhydrous)\n1.394 (decahydrate)","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic or hexagonal (anhydrous)\nmonoclinic (decahydrate)","ATC code":"A06AD13 (WHO) A12CA02 (WHO)","Main hazards":"Irritant","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nICSC 0952","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Sodium selenate\nSodium tellurate","Other cations":"Lithium sulfate\nPotassium sulfate\nRubidium sulfate\nCaesium sulfate","Related compounds":"Sodium bisulfate\nSodium sulfite\nSodium persulfate","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
