{"name":"Uranyl chloride","desc":"Uranyl chloride, UO2Cl2 is an unstable, bright yellow coloured chemical compound of uranium. It forms large sand-like crystals which are highly soluble in water, alcohols, and ethers. Uranyl chloride and its two hydrates, UO2Cl2·H2O and UO2Cl2·3H2O, decompose in the presence of light, a fact discovered by Adolph Gehlen in 1804. This photosensitivity periodically attracted scientific curiosity and various unsuccessful attempts to develop photographic applications using the salts. As with most other uranic species this compound also exhibits fluorescence.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Uranyl_chloride","IUPAC name":"Dichlorodioxouranium","Other names":"Uranium(VI), dichlorodioxy","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.315","Chemical formula":"UO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"340.90","Melting point":"Decomposes","Boiling point":"Decomposes","Solubility in other solvents":"320 @ 18C","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
