{"name":"Zirconium diboride","desc":"Zirconium diboride (ZrB2) is a highly covalent refractory ceramic material with a hexagonal crystal structure. ZrB2 is an ultra high temperature ceramic (UHTC) with a melting point of 3246 °C. This along with its relatively low density of ~6.09 g/cm3 (measured density may be higher due to hafnium impurities) and good high temperature strength makes it a candidate for high temperature aerospace applications such as hypersonic flight or rocket propulsion systems. It is an unusual ceramic, having relatively high thermal and electrical conductivities, properties it shares with isostructural titanium diboride and hafnium diboride.","images":[{"alt":"Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png/200px-Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"ZrB2 STM crop.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/ZrB2_STM_crop.png/220px-ZrB2_STM_crop.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Zirconium_boride","IUPAC name":"Zirconium diboride","Other names":"ZrB2","CAS Number":"12045-64-6 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.772","Chemical formula":"ZrB<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"112.85 g/mol","Appearance":"grey-black powder","Density":"6.085 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"~3246 °C","Solubility in water":"Insoluble","Crystal structure":"Hexagonal, hP3","Space group":"P6/mmm, No. 191","Main hazards":"Uninvestigated","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
