{"name":"Strontium chloride","desc":"Strontium chloride (SrCl2) is a salt of strontium and chloride. It is a typical salt, forming neutral aqueous solutions. Like all compounds of Sr, this salt emits a bright red colour in a flame; in fact it is used as a source of redness in fireworks. Its chemical properties are intermediate between those for barium chloride, which is more toxic, and calcium chloride.","images":[{"alt":"Strontium chloride hexahydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Strontium_chloride_hexahydrate.jpg/200px-Strontium_chloride_hexahydrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Strontium_chloride","IUPAC name":"Strontium chloride","Other names":"Strontium(II) chloride","CAS Number":"10476-85-4 Y\n10025-70-4 (hexahydrate) Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:36383 Y","ChemSpider":"55440 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.870","EC Number":"233-971-6","PubChem CID":"61520","UNII":"EKE8PS9J6Z Y","Chemical formula":"SrCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"158.53 g/mol (anhydrous)\n266.62 g/mol (hexahydrate)","Appearance":"White crystalline solid","Density":"3.052&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous, monoclinic form)<br>\n2.672&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)<br>\n1.930&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)","Melting point":"874 °C (1,605 °F; 1,147 K) (anhydrous)\n61 °C (hexahydrate)","Boiling point":"1,250 °C (2,280 °F; 1,520 K) (anhydrous)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous:\n53.8 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n\nhexahydrate:\n106 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n206 g/100 mL (40 °C)","Solubility":"ethanol: very slightly soluble\nacetone: very slightly soluble\nammonia: insoluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−63.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.650 (anhydrous)\n1.594 (dihydrate)\n1.536 (hexahydrate) [1]","Crystal structure":"Deformed rutile structure","Coordination geometry":"octahedral (six-coordinate)","Main hazards":"Irritant","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Strontium fluoride\nStrontium bromide\nStrontium iodide","Other cations":"Beryllium chloride\nMagnesium chloride\nCalcium chloride\nBarium chloride\nRadium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
