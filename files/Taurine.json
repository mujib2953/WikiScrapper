{"name":"Taurine","desc":"Taurine (/ˈtɔːriːn/), or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is an organic compound that is widely distributed in animal tissues. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine, and accounts for up to 0.1% of total human body weight. Taurine has many fundamental biological roles, such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. Taurine is unusual among biological molecules in being a sulfonic acid, while the vast majority of biologically occurring acids contain the more weakly acidic carboxyl group. While taurine is sometimes called an amino acid, and indeed is an acid containing an amino group, it is not an amino acid in the usual biochemical meaning of the term, which refers to compounds containing both an amino and a carboxyl group.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of taurine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Taurine.svg/200px-Taurine.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the taurine molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Taurine_molecule_ball.png/180px-Taurine_molecule_ball.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the taurine molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Taurine_molecule_spacefill.png/180px-Taurine_molecule_spacefill.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Taurine","Preferred IUPAC name":"2-Aminoethane-1-sulfonic acid\n2-Aminoethane-1-sulfonic acid","Other names":"2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid\nTauric acid","CAS Number":"107-35-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:15891 N","ChemSpider":"1091 Y","DrugBank":"DB01956 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.168","IUPHAR/BPS":"2379","PubChem CID":"1123","UNII":"1EQV5MLY3D Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"125.14 g/mol","Density":"1.734&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (at &#x2212;173.15&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"305.11 °C (581.20 °F; 578.26 K)","Acidity (pKa)":"<0, 9.06","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
