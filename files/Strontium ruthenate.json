{"name":"Strontium ruthenate","desc":"Strontium ruthenate (SRO) is an oxide of strontium and ruthenium with the chemical formula Sr2RuO4. It was the first reported perovskite superconductor that did not contain copper. Strontium ruthenate is structurally very similar to the high-temperature cuprate superconductors, and in particular, is almost identical to the lanthanum doped superconductor (La, Sr)2CuO4. However, the transition temperature for the superconducting phase transition is 0.93 K, which is much lower than the corresponding value for cuprates.","images":[{"alt":"strontium ruthenate unit cell","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Sr_2_Ru_O_4_Layered_Perovskite_Structure.svg/240px-Sr_2_Ru_O_4_Layered_Perovskite_Structure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Strontium_ruthenate","Chemical formula":"Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>"}
