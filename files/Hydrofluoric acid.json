{"name":"Hydrofluoric acid","desc":"Hydrofluoric acid is a solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in water. It is a precursor to almost all fluorine compounds, including pharmaceuticals such as fluoxetine (Prozac), diverse materials such as PTFE (Teflon), and elemental fluorine itself. It is a colourless solution that is highly corrosive, capable of dissolving many materials, especially oxides. Its ability to dissolve glass has been known since the 17th century, even before Carl Wilhelm Scheele prepared it in large quantities in 1771. Because of its high reactivity toward glass and moderate reactivity toward many metals, hydrofluoric acid is usually stored in plastic containers (although PTFE is slightly permeable to it).","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of hydrogen fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Hydrogen-fluoride-3D-vdW.svg/100px-Hydrogen-fluoride-3D-vdW.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the fluoride anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Fluoride_ion.svg/100px-Fluoride_ion.svg.png"},{"alt":"Hydrogen fluoride.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Hydrogen_fluoride.JPG/200px-Hydrogen_fluoride.JPG"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid","":"","Other names":"Fluorhydric acid\nHydronium fluoride","CAS Number":"7664-39-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29228 Y","ChemSpider":"14214 Y","EC Number":"231-634-8","RTECS number":"MW7875000","UNII":"RGL5YE86CZ Y","Chemical formula":"HF","Molar mass":"not applicable\n(see hydrogen fluoride)","Appearance":"Colorless solution","Density":"1.15 g/mL (for 48% soln.)","Melting point":"Not applicable\n(see hydrogen fluoride)","Boiling point":"Not applicable\n(see hydrogen fluoride)","Solubility in water":"Miscible.","Acidity (pKa)":"3.17[1]","Safety data sheet":"duPont MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"T+  C","R-phrases (outdated)":"R26/27/28, R35","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S7/9, S26, S36/37, S45","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n0\nACID","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Hydrochloric acid\nHydrobromic acid\nHydroiodic acid","Related compounds":"Hydrogen fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
