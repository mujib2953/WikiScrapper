{"name":"Phosphine","desc":"Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is the compound with the chemical formula PH3. It is a colorless, flammable, toxic gas and pnictogen hydride. Pure phosphine is odorless, but technical grade samples have a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, due to the presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphane (P2H4). With traces of P2H4 present, PH3 is spontaneously flammable in air, burning with a luminous flame. Phosphines are also a group of organophosphorus compounds with the formula R3P (R = organic derivative). Organophosphines are important in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; complexes derived from a chiral phosphine can catalyze reactions to give chiral, enantioenriched products.","images":[{"alt":"Phosphine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Monophosphan.svg/200px-Monophosphan.svg.png"},{"alt":"Phosphine-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Phosphine-3D-balls.png/100px-Phosphine-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Phosphine","":"","IUPAC name":"Phosphane","Other names":"Phosphamine\nPhosphorus trihydride\nPhosphorated hydrogen","CAS Number":"7803-51-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:30278 Y","ChemSpider":"22814 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.328","EC Number":"232-260-8","Gmelin Reference":"287","PubChem CID":"24404","RTECS number":"SY7525000","UN number":"2199","Chemical formula":"PH<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"33.99758 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless gas","Odor":"faint, fish-like or garlic-like[1]","Density":"1.379 g/l, gas (25 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−132.8 °C (−207.0 °F; 140.3 K)","Boiling point":"−87.7 °C (−125.9 °F; 185.5 K)","Solubility in water":"31.2 mg/100 ml (17 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, ether, CS2\nslightly soluble in benzene, chloroform, ethanol","Vapor pressure":"41.3 atm (20°C)[1]","Refractive index (nD)":"2.144","Viscosity":"1.1 x 10−5 Pa s","Molecular shape":"Trigonal pyramidal","Dipole moment":"0.58 D","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"210 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"5 kJ·mol−1[2]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0694","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"F+ (F+)\n T+ (T+)\n C (C)\n N (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12, R17, R26, R34, R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S28, S36/37, S45, S61, S63","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n2","Flash point":"flammable gas","Autoignition\ntemperature":"38 °C (100 °F; 311 K) see text","Explosive limits":"1.79% – 98% [1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"3.03 mg/kg (rat, oral)","LC50 (median concentration)":"11 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"1000 ppm (mammal, 5 min)\n270 ppm (mouse, 2 hr)\n100 ppm (guinea pig, 4 hr)\n50 ppm (cat, 2 hr)\n2500 ppm (rabbit, 20 min)\n1000 ppm (human, 5 min)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.3 ppm (0.4 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.3 ppm (0.4 mg/m3) ST 1 ppm (1 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"50 ppm[1]","Other cations":"Ammonia\nArsine\nStibine\nBismuthine","Related compounds":"Trimethylphosphine\nTriphenylphosphine","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
