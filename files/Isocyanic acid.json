{"name":"Isocyanic acid","desc":"Isocyanic acid is an organic compound with the formula HNCO, discovered in 1830 by Liebig and Wöhler. This colourless substance is volatile and poisonous, with a boiling point of 23.5 °C. Isocyanic acid is the simplest stable chemical compound that contains carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, the four most commonly found elements in organic chemistry and biology.","images":[{"alt":"Isocyansäure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Isocyans%C3%A4ure.svg/200px-Isocyans%C3%A4ure.svg.png"},{"alt":"Isocyanic acid 3D balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Isocyanic_acid_3D_balls.png/200px-Isocyanic_acid_3D_balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Isocyanic_acid","IUPAC name":"Isocyanic acid","[1]":"Carbimide[1]","CAS Number":"75-13-8 Y\n420-05-3 (cyanic acid) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:29202 Y","ChemSpider":"6107 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.109.068","PubChem CID":"6347","Chemical formula":"HNCO","Molar mass":"43.03 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless liquid or gas (b.p. near room temperature)","Density":"1.14 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−86 °C (−123 °F; 187 K)[2]","Boiling point":"23.5 °C (74.3 °F; 296.6 K)","Solubility in water":"Dissolves","Solubility":"Soluble in benzene, toluene, ether","Main hazards":"Poisonous","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
