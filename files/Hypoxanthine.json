{"name":"Hypoxanthine","desc":"Hypoxanthine is a naturally occurring purine derivative. It is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. It has a tautomer known as 6-hydroxypurine. Hypoxanthine is a necessary additive in certain cell, bacteria, and parasite cultures as a substrate and nitrogen source. For example, it is commonly a required reagent in malaria parasite cultures, since Plasmodium falciparum requires a source of hypoxanthine for nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism.","images":[{"alt":"Hypoxanthin.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Hypoxanthin.svg/200px-Hypoxanthin.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hypoxanthine","IUPAC name":"1H-purin-6(9H)-one","CAS Number":"68-94-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17368 Y","ChemSpider":"768 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.634","IUPHAR/BPS":"4555","KEGG":"C00262 Y","MeSH":"Hypoxanthine","PubChem CID":"790","UNII":"2TN51YD919 Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O","Molar mass":"136.112","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
