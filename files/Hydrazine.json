{"name":"Hydrazine","desc":"Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula N\n2H\n4 (also written H\n2NNH\n2), archaically called diamidogen. A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. As of 2000[update], approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of hydrazine with all explicit hydrogens added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Hydrazin.svg/100px-Hydrazin.svg.png"},{"alt":"Stereo, skeletal formula of hydrazine with all explicit hydrogens added","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Hydrazine-2D-A1.png/100px-Hydrazine-2D-A1.png"},{"alt":"Sample of hydrazine hydrate.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Sample_of_hydrazine_hydrate.jpg/200px-Sample_of_hydrazine_hydrate.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydrazine","":"","Systematic IUPAC name[2]":"Hydrazine[2]\nHydrazine[2]","[1][2]":"Diamine;[1] Diazane;[2] Tetrahydridodinitrogen (N—N)","CAS Number":"302-01-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","3DMet":"B00770","Beilstein Reference":"878137","ChEBI":"CHEBI:15571 Y","ChemSpider":"8960 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.560","EC Number":"206-114-9","Gmelin Reference":"190","KEGG":"C05361 Y","MeSH":"Hydrazine","PubChem CID":"9321","RTECS number":"MU7175000","UNII":"27RFH0GB4R Y","UN number":"2029","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">N<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span>H<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n4</span></span>","Molar mass":"32.0452 g mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless, fuming, oily liquid[3]","Odor":"ammonia-like[3]","Density":"1.021 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"2 °C; 35 °F; 275 K","Boiling point":"114 °C; 237 °F; 387 K","Solubility in water":"miscible[3]","log P":"0.67","Vapor pressure":"1 kP (at 30.7 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"8.10 (N2H5+)[4]","Basicity (pKb)":"5.90","Refractive index (nD)":"1.46044 (at 22 °C)","Viscosity":"0.876 cP","Molecular shape":"Triangular pyramidal at N","Dipole moment":"1.85 D[5]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"121.52 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"50.63 kJ mol−1","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0281","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H226, H301, H311, H314, H317, H331, H350, H410","GHS precautionary statements":"P201, P261, P273, P280, P301+310, P305+351+338","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n3","Flash point":"52 °C (126 °F; 325 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"24 to 270 °C (75 to 518 °F; 297 to 543 K)","Explosive limits":"1.8–99.99%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"59–60 mg/kg (oral in rats, mice)[6]","LC50 (median concentration)":"260 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n630 ppm (rat, 1 hr)\n570 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n252 ppm (mouse, 4 hr)[7]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 1 ppm (1.3 mg/m3) [skin][3]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca C 0.03 ppm (0.04 mg/m3) [2-hour][3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [50 ppm][3]","Other anions":"tetrafluorohydrazine\nhydrogen peroxide\ndiphosphane\ndiphosphorus tetraiodide","Other cations":"organic hydrazines","Related Binary azanes":"Ammonia\ntriazane","Related compounds":"diazene\ntriazene\ntetrazene\ndiphosphene","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
