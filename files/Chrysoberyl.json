The name chrysoberyl is derived from the Greek words χρυσός chrysos and βήρυλλος beryllos, meaning \"a gold-white spar\". Despite the similarity of their names, chrysoberyl and beryl are two completely different gemstones, although they both contain beryllium. Chrysoberyl is the third-hardest frequently encountered natural gemstone and lies at 8.5 on the hardness scale, between corundum (9) and topaz (8).","images":[{"alt":"Chrysoberyl-282796.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Chrysoberyl-282796.jpg/260px-Chrysoberyl-282796.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Beryllium_aluminium_oxide"}
