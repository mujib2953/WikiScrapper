{"name":"Beryllium oxide","desc":"Beryllium oxide (BeO), also known as beryllia, is an inorganic compound with the formula BeO. This colourless solid is a notable electrical insulator with a higher thermal conductivity than any other non-metal except diamond, and exceeds that of most metals. As an amorphous solid, beryllium oxide is white. Its high melting point leads to its use as a refractory. It occurs in nature as the mineral bromellite. Historically and in materials science, beryllium oxide was called glucina or glucinium oxide. Formation of BeO from beryllium and oxygen releases the highest energy per mass of reactants for any chemical reaction, close to 24 MJ/kg.[citation needed]","images":[{"alt":"Unit cell, ball and stick model of beryllium oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Wurtzite_polyhedra.png/200px-Wurtzite_polyhedra.png"},{"alt":"BeO sample.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/BeO_sample.jpg/200px-BeO_sample.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Beryllium_oxide","Preferred IUPAC name":"Beryllium(II) monoxide\nBeryllium(II) monoxide","Systematic IUPAC name":"Oxoberyllium\nOxoberyllium","[1]":"Beryllia, Thermalox, Natural bromellite, Thermalox 995.[1]","CAS Number":"1304-56-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","Beilstein Reference":"3902801","ChEBI":"CHEBI:62842 N","ChemSpider":"14092 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.758","EC Number":"215-133-1","MeSH":"beryllium+oxide","PubChem CID":"14775","RTECS number":"DS4025000","UN number":"1566","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Beryllium\">Be</span><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"25.01 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colourless, vitreous crystals","Odor":"Odourless","Density":"3.01 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>","Melting point":"2,507 °C (4,545 °F; 2,780 K)","Boiling point":"3,900 °C (7,050 °F; 4,170 K)","Solubility in water":"0.00002 g/100 mL","Band gap":"10.6 eV","Thermal conductivity":"330 W K−1 m−1","Refractive index (nD)":"1.719","Crystal structure":"Hexagonal","Space group":"P63mc","Point group":"C6v","Coordination geometry":"Tetragonal","Molecular shape":"Linear","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"25.5 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"13.73–13.81 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−599 kJ/mol[2]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"−582 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"DANGER","GHS hazard statements":"H301, H315, H317, H319, H330, H335, H350, H372","GHS precautionary statements":"P201, P260, P280, P284, P301+310, P305+351+338","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2062 mg kg−1 (mouse, oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.002 mg/m3\nC 0.005 mg/m3 (30 minutes), with a maximum peak of 0.025 mg/m3 (as Be)[3]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca C 0.0005 mg/m3 (as Be)[3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [4 mg/m3 (as Be)][3]","Other anions":"Beryllium telluride","Other cations":"Magnesium oxide\nCalcium oxide","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
