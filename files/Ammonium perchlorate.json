{"name":"Ammonium perchlorate","desc":"Ammonium perchlorate (\"AP\") is an inorganic compound with the formula NH4ClO4. It is a colorless or white solid that is soluble in water. Perchlorate is a powerful oxidizer and ammonium is a good fuel. This combination explains the usefulness of this material as a rocket propellant. Its instability has involved it in a number of accidents, such as the PEPCON disaster.","images":[{"alt":"Ammonium perchlorate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Ammonium_perchlorate.png/150px-Ammonium_perchlorate.png"},{"alt":"Unit cell of the crystal structure","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Ammonium-perchlorate-unit-cell-3D-balls-B.png/200px-Ammonium-perchlorate-unit-cell-3D-balls-B.png"},{"alt":"Ammonium perchlorate 100g.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Ammonium_perchlorate_100g.jpg/200px-Ammonium_perchlorate_100g.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate","IUPAC name":"Ammonium perchlorate","Other names":"AP","CAS Number":"7790-98-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23041 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.305","EC Number":"232-235-1","RTECS number":"SC7520000","UN number":"1442","Chemical formula":"NH<sub>4</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"117.49 g/mol","Appearance":"White Crystalline [1]","Density":"1.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"Exothermic decomposition before melting at >200 °C[2]","Solubility in water":"11.56 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n20.85 g/100 mL (20 °C)\n57.01 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"Soluble in Methanol\npartially soluble in Acetone\ninsoluble in Ether","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic (< 513 K)\nCubic (> 513 K)","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS [3]","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Oxidant (O)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R9, R44","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S14, S16, S27, S36/37","NFPA 704":"1\n2\n2\nOX","Autoignition\ntemperature":"240 °C (464 °F; 513 K)","Other anions":"Ammonium chlorate\nAmmonium chloride","Other cations":"Potassium perchlorate\nSodium perchlorate\nLithium perchlorate","Related compounds":"Perchloric acid","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
