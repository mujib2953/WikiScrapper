{"name":"Dysprosium(III) chloride","desc":"Dysprosium(III) chloride (DyCl3), also known as dysprosium trichloride, is a compound of dysprosium and chlorine. It is a white to yellow solid which rapidly absorbs water on exposure to moist air to form a hexahydrate, DyCl3.6H2O. Simple rapid heating of the hydrate causes partial hydrolysis to an oxychloride, DyOCl.","images":[{"alt":"Dysprosium(III) chloride hexahydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dysprosium%28III%29_chloride.jpg/200px-Dysprosium%28III%29_chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Dysprosium(III)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Dysprosium(III) chloride\nDysprosium trichloride","CAS Number":"10025-74-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"59592 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.024","PubChem CID":"66207","UNII":"Q2A03W637H N","Chemical formula":"DyCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"268.86 g/mol (anhydrous)","Appearance":"white solid","Density":"3.67 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"647 °C (1,197 °F; 920 K) (anhydrous)","Boiling point":"1,530 °C (2,790 °F; 1,800 K)","Solubility in water":"Soluble","Crystal structure":"AlCl3 structure","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Dysprosium(III) fluoride\nDysprosium(III) bromide\nDysprosium(III) iodide\nDysprosium(III) oxide","Other cations":"Terbium(III) chloride\nDysprosium(II) chloride\nHolmium(III) chloride","Related compounds":"Dysprosium(II) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
