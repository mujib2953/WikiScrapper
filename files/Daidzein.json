{"name":"Daidzein","desc":"Daidzein (7-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one) is a naturally occurring compound found exclusively in soybeans and other legumes and structurally belongs to a class of compounds known as isoflavones. Daidzein and other isoflavones are produced in plants through the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolism and are used as signal carriers, and defense responses to pathogenic attacks.  In humans, recent research has shown the viability of using daidzein in medicine for menopausal relief, osteoporosis, blood cholesterol, and lowering the risk of some hormone-related cancers, and heart disease.","images":[{"alt":"Daidzein.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Daidzein.svg/220px-Daidzein.svg.png"},{"alt":"Diazein molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Daidzein-3D-balls.png/220px-Daidzein-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Daidzein","IUPAC name":"7-Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) chromen-4-one","Other names":"4',7-Dihydroxyisoflavone\nDaidzeol\nIsoaurostatin","CAS Number":"486-66-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28197 Y","ChemSpider":"4445025 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.006.942","IUPHAR/BPS":"2828","KEGG":"C10208 Y","PubChem CID":"5281708","UNII":"6287WC5J2L Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"254.23 g/mol","Appearance":"Pale yellow prisms","Melting point":"315 to 323 °C (599 to 613 °F; 588 to 596 K) (decomposes)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
