{"name":"Cerium(IV) oxide","desc":"Cerium(IV) oxide, also known as ceric oxide, ceric dioxide, ceria, cerium oxide or cerium dioxide, is an oxide of the rare-earth metal cerium. It is a pale yellow-white powder with the chemical formula CeO2. It is an important commercial product and an intermediate in the purification of the element from the ores. The distinctive property of this material is its reversible conversion to a nonstoichiometric oxide.","images":[{"alt":"Cerium(IV) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Cerium%28IV%29_oxide.jpg/200px-Cerium%28IV%29_oxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Ceria-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Ceria-3D-ionic.png/200px-Ceria-3D-ionic.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cerium(IV)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Cerium(IV) oxide","Other names":"Ceric oxide,\nCeria,\nCerium dioxide","CAS Number":"1306-38-3 Y\n12014-56-1 (monohydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:79089 N","ChemSpider":"8395107 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.774","PubChem CID":"73963","UNII":"619G5K328Y N","Chemical formula":"CeO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"172.115 g/mol","Appearance":"white or pale yellow solid,\nslightly hygroscopic","Density":"7.215 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,400 °C (4,350 °F; 2,670 K)","Boiling point":"3,500 °C (6,330 °F; 3,770 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+26.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic (fluorite)[1]","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Related compounds":"Cerium(III) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
