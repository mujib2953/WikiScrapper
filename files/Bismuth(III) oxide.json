{"name":"Bismuth(III) oxide","desc":"Bismuth(III) oxide is perhaps the most industrially important compound of bismuth. It is also a common starting point for bismuth chemistry. It is found naturally as the mineral bismite (monoclinic) and sphaerobismoite (tetragonal, much more rare), but it is usually obtained as a by-product of the smelting of copper and lead ores. Bismuth trioxide is commonly used to produce the \"Dragon's eggs\" effect in fireworks, as a replacement of red lead.","images":[{"alt":"Bismuth trioxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Bismuth%28III%29_oxide_2.jpg/200px-Bismuth%28III%29_oxide_2.jpg"},{"alt":"AlfaBi2O3structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/AlfaBi2O3structure.jpg/200px-AlfaBi2O3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Bismuth(III)_oxide","IUPAC namesBismite":"Bismuth trioxide\nBismuth(III) oxide\nBismite (mineral)","Other names":"Bismite, bismuth sesquioxide","CAS Number":"1304-76-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"14093 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.759","UNII":"A6I4E79QF1 Y","Chemical formula":"Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"465.96 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow crystals or powder","Odor":"odorless","Density":"8.90 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"817 °C (1,503 °F; 1,090 K)[1]","Boiling point":"1,890 °C (3,430 °F; 2,160 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Solubility":"soluble in acids","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-83.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"monoclinic, mP20,\nSpace group P21/c (No 14)","Coordination geometry":"pseudo-octahedral","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nMallBaker MSDS","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"not listed","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Bismuth trisulfide","Other cations":"Arsenic trioxide\nAntimony trioxide","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
