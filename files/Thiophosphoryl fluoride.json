{"name":"Thiophosphoryl fluoride","desc":"Thiophosphoryl fluoride is an inorganic molecular gas with formula PSF3 containing phosphorus, sulfur and fluorine. It spontaneously ignites in air and burns with a cool flame. The discoverers were able to have flames around their hands without discomfort, and called it \"probably one of the coldest flames known\". The gas was discovered in 1888.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of thiophosphoryl fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Thiophosphoryl_fluoride.svg/105px-Thiophosphoryl_fluoride.svg.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Thiophosphoryl_fluoride","":"","IUPAC name[3]":"Trifluoro(sulfanylidene)-λ5-phosphane[3]","[1][2]":"Phosphorothioc trifluoride,[1] Phosphorothioic trifluoride, Phosphorus fluoride sulfide, Phosphorus sulfurtrifluoride, Phosphorus thiofluoride, Thiophosphoryl trifluoride, Trifluorophosphine sulfide, trifluoro-λ5-phosphanethione [2]","CAS Number":"2404-52-6 N","3D model (JSmol)":"[4]: Interactive image","ChemSpider":"121246 N","Chemical formula":"PSF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"120.035 g/mol","Appearance":"Colorless gas or liquid","Density":"1.56g/cm<sup>3</sup> liquid<sup id=\"cite_ref-hg_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hg-5\">[5]</a></sup> 4.906 g/L as gas<sup id=\"cite_ref-hb87_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hb87-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"−148.8 °C (−235.8 °F; 124.3 K)","Boiling point":"−52.25 °C (−62.05 °F; 220.90 K)","Solubility in water":"slight, Highly reactive","Molecular shape":"tetrahedron;","Main hazards":"Spontaneously flammable in air; toxic fumes","Flash point":"very low","Related compounds":"Phosphoryl trifluoride\nPhosphorus trifluoride\nThiazyl trifluoride\nPSeF3\nThiophosphoryl chloride"}
