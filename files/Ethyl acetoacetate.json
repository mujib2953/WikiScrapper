{"name":"Ethyl acetoacetate","desc":"The organic compound ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) is the ethyl ester of acetoacetic acid. It is mainly used as a chemical intermediate in the production of a wide variety of compounds, such as amino acids, analgesics, antibiotics, antimalarial agents, antipyrine and aminopyrine, and vitamin B1; as well as the manufacture of dyes, inks, lacquers, perfumes, plastics, and yellow paint pigments. Alone, it is used as a flavoring for food.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of ethyl acetoacetate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Ethyl_acetoacetate-Structural_Formula_V.1.svg/200px-Ethyl_acetoacetate-Structural_Formula_V.1.svg.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling model of the ethyl acetoacetate molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Ethyl_acetoacetate_3D_spacefill.png/200px-Ethyl_acetoacetate_3D_spacefill.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ethyl_acetoacetate","IUPAC name":"Ethyl 3-oxobutanoate","Other names":"Acetoacetic acid ethyl ester\nEthyl acetylacetate\n3-Oxobutanoic acid ethyl ester\n\n\n\n\nAcetoacetic acid ethyl ester\nEthyl acetylacetate\n3-Oxobutanoic acid ethyl ester","CAS Number":"141-97-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"13865426 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.015","KEGG":"C03500 Y","RTECS number":"AK5250000","UNII":"IZP61H3TB1 Y","Chemical formula":"C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"130.14 g/mol","Appearance":"Colourless liquid","Odor":"Fruit or rum","Density":"1.021 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, liquid","Melting point":"−45 °C (−49 °F; 228 K)","Boiling point":"180.8 °C (357.4 °F; 453.9 K)","Solubility in water":"2.86 g/100 ml (20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"10.68 (in H2O)\n14.2 (in DMSO)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−71.67×10−6 cm3/mol","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Not listed","NFPA 704":"2\n2","Flash point":"70 °C (158 °F; 343 K)","Related esters":"Methyl acetoacetate\nEthyl acetate\nDiethyl malonate","Related compounds":"Acetone\nAcetylacetone\nDiketene","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
