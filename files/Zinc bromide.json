{"name":"Zinc bromide","desc":"Zinc bromide (ZnBr2) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula ZnBr2. It is a colourless salt that shares many properties with zinc chloride (ZnCl2), namely a high solubility in water forming acidic solutions, and solubility in organic solvents. It is hygroscopic and forms a dihydrate ZnBr2 · 2H2O.","images":[{"alt":"Zinc bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bromid_zine%C4%8Dnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Bromid_zine%C4%8Dnat%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"Zinc bromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Zinc-bromide-xtal-3D-SF.png/200px-Zinc-bromide-xtal-3D-SF.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_bromide","IUPAC name":"Zinc bromide","Other names":"Zinc(II) bromide,\nZinc dibromide","CAS Number":"7699-45-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22790 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.836","PubChem CID":"24375","RTECS number":"ZH1150000","UNII":"OO7ZBU9703 Y","Chemical formula":"ZnBr<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"225.198 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystalline powder\nhygroscopic","Density":"4.20 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 &#xB0;C)<br>\n4.22 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (25 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"394 °C (741 °F; 667 K)","Boiling point":"697 °C (1,287 °F; 970 K)","Solubility in water":"311 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n447 g/100 mL (20 °C)[1]\n538 g/100 mL (100 °C)[2]","Solubility":"very soluble in alcohol, ether, acetone, tetrahydrofuran","Refractive index (nD)":"1.5452","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Zinc fluoride,\nZinc chloride,\nZinc iodide","Other cations":"Cadmium bromide,\nMercury(II) bromide,\nCalcium bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
