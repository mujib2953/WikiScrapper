{"name":"Sulfuryl fluoride","desc":"Sulfuryl fluoride (also spelled sulphuryl fluoride) is the inorganic compound with the formula SO2F2. It is an easily condensed gas and has properties more similar to sulfur hexafluoride than sulfuryl chloride, being resistant to hydrolysis even up to 150 °C. It is neurotoxic and a potent greenhouse gas, but is widely used as a fumigant insecticide to control termites.","images":[{"alt":"Structure and dimensions of sulfuryl fluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Sulfuryl-fluoride-2D-dimensions.png/120px-Sulfuryl-fluoride-2D-dimensions.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sulfuryl_difluoride","":"","IUPAC name":"Sulfuryl fluoride","Other names":"Sulfonyl fluoride; Sulfur dioxide difluoride; Sulphuryl fluoride; Sulfuryl difluoride; Vikane","CAS Number":"2699-79-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:39287 Y","ChemSpider":"16647 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.018.437","PubChem CID":"17607","Chemical formula":"SO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"102.06 g/mol","Appearance":"colourless gas","Odor":"odorless[1]","Density":"4.172 g/L (gas), 1.632 g/mL (liquid under compressed gas at 0 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−124.7 °C (−192.5 °F; 148.5 K)","Boiling point":"−55.4 °C (−67.7 °F; 217.8 K)","Solubility in water":"0.2% (0°C)[1]","Solubility in other solvents":"SO2","Vapor pressure":"15.8 atm (21°C)[1]","Coordination geometry":"tetrahedral","Main hazards":"toxic","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"991 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[2]","LCLo (lowest published)":"1200 ppm (mouse, 1 hr)\n5000 ppm (rabbit, 1 hr)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5 ppm (20 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 5 ppm (20 mg/m3) ST 10 ppm (40 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"200 ppm[1]","Related compounds":"SO2Cl2,\nSO2ClF,\nSF6,\nSO3","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
