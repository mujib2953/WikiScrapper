{"name":"Potassium cyanide","desc":"Potassium cyanide is a compound with the formula KCN. This colorless crystalline salt, similar in appearance to sugar, is highly soluble in water. Most KCN is used in gold mining, organic synthesis, and electroplating. Smaller applications include jewelry for chemical gilding and buffing.","images":[{"alt":"Potassium-cyanide-phase-I-unit-cell-3D-SF.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Potassium-cyanide-phase-I-unit-cell-3D-SF.png/200px-Potassium-cyanide-phase-I-unit-cell-3D-SF.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Potassium_cyanide","IUPAC name":"Potassium cyanide","CAS Number":"151-50-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33191 N","ChemSpider":"8681 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.267","EC Number":"205-792-3","PubChem CID":"9032","RTECS number":"TS8750000","UNII":"MQD255M2ZO Y","UN number":"1680","Chemical formula":"KCN","Molar mass":"65.12 g/mol","Appearance":"White crystalline solid\ndeliquescent","Odor":"faint, almond-like","Density":"1.52 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"634.5 °C (1,174.1 °F; 907.6 K)","Boiling point":"1,625 °C (2,957 °F; 1,898 K)","Solubility in water":"71.6 g/100 ml (25 °C)\n100 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility in methanol":"4.91 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Solubility in glycerol":"soluble","Solubility in formamide":"14.6 g/100 mL","Solubility in ethanol":"0.57 g/100mL","Solubility in hydroxylamine":"41 g/100 mL","Acidity (pKa)":"11.0","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−37.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.410","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"127.8 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−131.5 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0671","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H290, H300, H310, H330, H370, H372, H410","GHS precautionary statements":"P260, P264, P273, P280, P284, P301+310","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"5 mg/kg (oral, rabbit)\n10 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n5 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n8.5 mg/kg (oral, mouse)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5 mg/m3[1]","REL (Recommended)":"C 5 mg/m3 (4.7 ppm) [10-minute][1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"25 mg/m3[1]","Other anions":"Potassium cyanate\nPotassium thiocyanate","Other cations":"Sodium cyanide","Related compounds":"Hydrogen cyanide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
