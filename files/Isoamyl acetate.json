{"name":"Isoamyl acetate","desc":"Isoamyl acetate, also known as isopentyl acetate, is an organic compound that is the ester formed from isoamyl alcohol and acetic acid. It is a colorless liquid that is only slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in most organic solvents. Isoamyl acetate has a strong odor which is also described as similar to both banana and pear. Banana oil may be either pure isoamyl acetate, or flavorings that are mixtures of isoamyl acetate, amyl acetate, and other flavors.","images":[{"alt":"Isoamyl acetate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Isoamyl_acetate.svg/200px-Isoamyl_acetate.svg.png"},{"alt":"Isoamyl-acetate-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Isoamyl-acetate-3D-balls.png/200px-Isoamyl-acetate-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Isoamyl_acetate","Preferred IUPAC name":"3-Methylbutyl acetate\n3-Methylbutyl acetate","Systematic IUPAC name":"3-Methylbutyl ethanoate\n3-Methylbutyl ethanoate","Other names":"Isopentyl acetate\nIsopentyl ethanoate\nIsoamyl acetate\nBanana oil\nPear essence","CAS Number":"123-92-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:31725 Y","ChemSpider":"29016 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.004.240","KEGG":"C12296 Y","UNII":"Z135787824 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>14</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"130.19 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"Banana-like[1]","Density":"0.876 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"−78 °C (−108 °F; 195 K)","Boiling point":"142 °C (288 °F; 415 K)","Solubility in water":"0.3% (20 °C)[1]","Vapor pressure":"4 mmHg (20 °C)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-89.4·10−6 cm3/mol","NFPA 704":"3\n1\n0","Flash point":"25 °C (77 °F; 298 K)","Explosive limits":"1.0% (100 °C) - 7.5%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"7422 mg/kg (rabbit, oral)\n16,600 mg/kg (rat, oral)[2]","LCLo (lowest published)":"6470 ppm (cat)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 100 ppm (525 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 100 ppm (525 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1000 ppm[1]","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
