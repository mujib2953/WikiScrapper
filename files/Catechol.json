{"name":"Catechol","desc":"Catechol (/ˈkætᵻtʃɒl/), also known as pyrocatechol or 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, is an organic compound with the molecular formula C6H4(OH)2. It is the ortho isomer of the three isomeric benzenediols. This colorless compound occurs naturally in trace amounts. It was first discovered by destructive distillation of the plant extract catechin. About 20 million kg are now synthetically produced annually as a commodity organic chemical, mainly as a precursor to pesticides, flavors, and fragrances.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Brenzcatechin.svg/100px-Brenzcatechin.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Catechol","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Benzene-1,2-diol[1]\nBenzene-1,2-diol[1]","[1]":"Pyrocatechol[1]\n1,2-Benzenediol\n2-Hydroxyphenol\n1,2-Dihydroxybenzene\no-Benzenediol\no-Dihydroxybenzene","CAS Number":"120-80-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18135 N","ChemSpider":"283 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.004.025","EC Number":"204-427-5","KEGG":"C00090 Y","PubChem CID":"289","RTECS number":"UX1050000","Chemical formula":"C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"110.1 g/mol","Appearance":"white to brown feathery crystals","Odor":"faint, phenolic odor","Density":"1.344 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"105 °C (221 °F; 378 K)","Boiling point":"245.5 °C (473.9 °F; 518.6 K) (sublimes)","Solubility in water":"430 g/L","Solubility":"very soluble in pyridine\nsoluble in chloroform, benzene, CCl4, ether, ethyl acetate","log P":"0.88","Vapor pressure":"20 Pa (20 °C)","Acidity (pKa)":"9.48","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-68.76·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.604","Dipole moment":"2.62±0.03 D [2]","Crystal structure":"monoclinic","Safety data sheet":"Sigma-Aldrich","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Harmful (Xn)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R21/22, R36/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S2), S22, S26, S37","NFPA 704":"1\n3\n0","Flash point":"127 °C (261 °F; 400 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"510 °C (950 °F; 783 K)","Explosive limits":"1.4%-?[3]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"300 mg/kg (rat, oral)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"none[3]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 5 ppm (20 mg/m3) [skin][3]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[3]","Related benzenediols":"Resorcinol\nHydroquinone","Related compounds":"1,2-benzoquinone","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
