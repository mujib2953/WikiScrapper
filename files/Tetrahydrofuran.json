{"name":"Tetrahydrofuran","desc":"Tetrahydrofuran (THF), whose preferred IUPAC name was changed in 2013 to oxolane, is an organic compound with the formula (CH2)4O. The compound is classified as heterocyclic compound, specifically a cyclic ether. It is a colorless, water-miscible organic liquid with low viscosity. It is mainly used as a precursor to polymers. Being polar and having a wide liquid range, THF is a versatile solvent.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of tetrahydrofuran","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Tetrahydrofuran-2D-skeletal-A.png/90px-Tetrahydrofuran-2D-skeletal-A.png"},{"alt":"Photograph of a glass bottle of tetrahydrofuran","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Tetrahydrofuran_sample.jpg/200px-Tetrahydrofuran_sample.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Tetrahydrofuran","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Oxolane\nOxolane","Other names":"Tetrahydrofuran\n1,4-Epoxybutane\nButylene oxide\nCyclotetramethylene oxide\nOxacyclopentane\nDiethylene oxide\nTetra-methylene oxide","CAS Number":"109-99-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Abbreviations":"THF","ChEBI":"CHEBI:26911 N","ChemSpider":"7737 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.389","PubChem CID":"8028","RTECS number":"LU5950000","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span>","Molar mass":"72.11 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless liquid","Odor":"ether-like[1]","Density":"0.8892 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at 20&#xA0;&#xB0;C, liquid","Melting point":"−108.4 °C (−163.1 °F; 164.8 K)","Boiling point":"66 °C (151 °F; 339 K)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Vapor pressure":"132 mmHg (20 °C)[1]","Viscosity":"0.48 cP at 25 °C","Molecular shape":"envelope","Dipole moment":"1.63 D (gas)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Flammable (F)\nIrritant (Xi)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R11, R19, R20/21/22, R36/37","S-phrases (outdated)":"S16, S29, S33","NFPA 704":"3\n2\n1","Flash point":"−14 °C (7 °F; 259 K)","Explosive limits":"2%–11.8%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"1650 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n2300 mg/kg (mouse, oral)\n2300 mg/kg (guinea pig, oral)[2]","LC50 (median concentration)":"21000 ppm (rat, 3 hr)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 200 ppm (590 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 200 ppm (590 mg/m3) ST 250 ppm (735 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"2000 ppm[1]","Related heterocycles":"Furan\nPyrrolidine\nDioxane","Related compounds":"Diethyl ether","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
