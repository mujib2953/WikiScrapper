{"name":"Caesium chloride","desc":"Caesium chloride or cesium chloride, is the inorganic compound with the formula CsCl. This colorless solid is an important source of caesium ions in a variety of niche applications. Its crystal structure forms a major structural type where each caesium ion is coordinated by 8 chlorine ions. Caesium chloride dissolves in water. Caesium chloride occurs naturally as impurities in carnallite (up to 0.002%), sylvite and kainite. Less than 20 tonnes of CsCl is produced annually worldwide, mostly from a caesium-bearing mineral pollucite.","images":[{"alt":"Caesium chloride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Caesium_chloride.jpg/230px-Caesium_chloride.jpg"},{"alt":"CsCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/CsCl_polyhedra.png/230px-CsCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Caesium_chloride","IUPAC name":"Caesium chloride","Other names":"Cesium chloride","CAS Number":"7647-17-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22713 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.728","EC Number":"231-600-2","PubChem CID":"24943","UNII":"GNR9HML8BA Y","Chemical formula":"CsCl","Molar mass":"168.36 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid\nhygroscopic","Density":"3.988 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-r1_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-r1-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"646 °C (1,195 °F; 919 K)[1]","Boiling point":"1,297 °C (2,367 °F; 1,570 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"1910 g/L (25 °C)[1]","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol[1]","Band gap":"8.35 eV (80 K)[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-56.7·10−6 cm3/mol[3]","Refractive index (nD)":"1.712 (0.3 µm)\n1.640 (0.59 µm)\n1.631 (0.75 µm)\n1.626 (1 µm)\n1.616 (5 µm)\n1.563 (20 µm)[4]","Crystal structure":"CsCl, cP2","Space group":"Pm3m, No. 221[5]","Lattice constant":"a = 0.4119 nm","Lattice volume (V)":"0.0699 nm3","Formula units (Z)":"1","Coordination geometry":"Cubic (Cs+)\nCubic (Cl−)","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2600 mg/kg (oral, rat)[6]","Other anions":"Caesium fluoride\nCaesium bromide\nCaesium iodide\nCaesium astatide","Other cations":"Lithium chloride\nSodium chloride\nPotassium chloride\nRubidium chloride\nFrancium chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
