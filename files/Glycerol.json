{"name":"Glycerol","desc":"Glycerol (/ˈɡlɪsərɒl/; also called glycerine or glycerin; see spelling differences) is a simple polyol compound. It is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic. The glycerol backbone is found in all lipids known as triglycerides. It is widely used in the food industry as a sweetener and humectant and in pharmaceutical formulations. Glycerol has three hydroxyl groups that are responsible for its solubility in water and its hygroscopic nature.","images":[{"alt":"Glycerol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Glycerin_Skelett.svg/200px-Glycerin_Skelett.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of glycerol","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Glycerol-3D-balls.png/100px-Glycerol-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Sample of glycerine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Sample_of_Glycerine.jpg/200px-Sample_of_Glycerine.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Glycerol","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Propane-1,2,3-triol\nPropane-1,2,3-triol","Other names":"Glycerin\nGlycerine\nPropanetriol\n1,2,3-Trihydroxypropane\n1,2,3-Propanetriol","CAS Number":"56-81-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17522 Y","ChemSpider":"733 Y","DrugBank":"DB04077 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.263","E number":"E422 (thickeners, ...)","IUPHAR/BPS":"5195","KEGG":"D00028 Y","PubChem CID":"753","UNII":"PDC6A3C0OX Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>3</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"92.09 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless liquid\nhygroscopic","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.261 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"17.8 °C (64.0 °F; 290.9 K)","Boiling point":"290 °C (554 °F; 563 K)[3]","Solubility in water":"miscible[1]","Vapor pressure":"0.003 mmHg (50°C)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-57.06·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.4746","Viscosity":"1.412 Pa·s[2]","ATC code":"A06AG04 (WHO) A06AX01 (WHO), QA16QA03 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nJT Baker","NFPA 704":"1\n0\n0","Flash point":"160 °C (320 °F; 433 K) (closed cup)\n176 °C (349 °F; 449 K) (open cup)","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 15 mg/m3 (total) TWA 5 mg/m3 (resp)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"None established[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"N.D.[1]","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
