{"name":"Hydroxide","desc":"Hydroxide is a diatomic anion with chemical formula OH−. It consists of an oxygen and hydrogen atom held together by a covalent bond, and carries a negative electric charge. It is an important but usually minor constituent of water. It functions as a base, a ligand, a nucleophile and a catalyst. The hydroxide ion forms salts, some of which dissociate in aqueous solution, liberating solvated hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is a multi-million-ton per annum commodity chemical. A hydroxide attached to a strongly electropositive center may itself ionize,[citation needed] liberating a hydrogen cation (H+), making the parent compound an acid.","images":[{"alt":"Lewis structure of the hydroxide ion showing three lone pairs on the oxygen atom","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Hydroxide_lone_pairs-2D.svg/170px-Hydroxide_lone_pairs-2D.svg.png"},{"alt":"Space-filling representation of the hydroxide ion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Hydroxide-3D-vdW.png/100px-Hydroxide-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hydroxide_ion","":"","Systematic IUPAC name":"Hydroxide\nHydroxide","CAS Number":"14280-30-9","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16234","ChemSpider":"936","PubChem CID":"961","UNII":"9159UV381P","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">OH<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:0.8em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\">&#x2212;<br></span></span>","Molar mass":"17.01 g·mol−1"}
