{"name":"Titanium tetrabromide","desc":"Titanium tetrabromide is the chemical compound with the formula TiBr4. It is the most volatile transition metal bromide. The properties of TiBr4 are an average of TiCl4 and TiI4. Some key properties of these four-coordinated Ti(IV) species are their high Lewis acidity and their high solubility in nonpolar organic solvents. TiBr4 is diamagnetic, reflecting the d0 configuration of the metal centre.","images":[{"alt":"Titanium tetrabromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/TiBr4.png/200px-TiBr4.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the titanium tetrabromide molecule","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Titanium-tetrabromide-3D-balls.png/200px-Titanium-tetrabromide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Titanium(IV)_bromide","IUPAC name":"Titanium tetrabromide","Other names":"Titanium(IV) bromide","CAS Number":"7789-68-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.259","EC Number":"232-185-0","PubChem CID":"123263","Chemical formula":"TiBr<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"367.483 g/mol","Appearance":"brown crystals\nhygroscopic","Density":"3.25 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"39 °C (102 °F; 312 K)","Boiling point":"230 °C (446 °F; 503 K)","Solubility in water":"dissolves,then hydrolyses","Solubility in other solvents":"chlorocarbons, benzene","Crystal structure":"cubic, Pa3, Z = 8","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral","Dipole moment":"0 D","Main hazards":"corrosive","R-phrases (outdated)":"14-34","S-phrases (outdated)":"26-36/37/39-45","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"TiCl4\nTiI4","Other cations":"VCl4","Related compounds":"TiCl3\nVBr3","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
