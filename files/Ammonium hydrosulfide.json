{"name":"Ammonium hydrosulfide","desc":"Ammonium hydrosulfide is the chemical compound with the formula (NH4)SH. It is the salt derived from the ammonium cation and the hydrosulfide anion. The salt exists as colourless, water-soluble, micaceous crystals. On Earth the compound is encountered mainly as a solution, not as the solid, but NH4SH ice is believed to be a substantial component of the cloud decks of the gas-giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, with sulfur produced by its photolysis responsible for the color of some of those planets' clouds. It can be generated by mixing hydrogen sulfide and ammonia.","images":[{"alt":"Ammonium-2D.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Ammonium-2D.svg/100px-Ammonium-2D.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ammonium_hydrosulfide","":"","IUPAC name":"ammonium hydrosulfide","Other names":"ammonium bisulfide\nammonium hydrogen sulfide","CAS Number":"12124-99-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"23805 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.974","RTECS number":"BS4900000","Chemical formula":"H<sub>5</sub>NS","Molar mass":"51.111 g/mol","Appearance":"Yellow-orange fuming liquid.","Density":"1.17 g/cm<sup>3</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Boiling point":"56.6 °C (133.9 °F; 329.8 K)","Solubility in water":"Miscible","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, liquid ammonia, liquid hydrogen sulfide; insoluble in benzene, hexane and ether","Refractive index (nD)":"1.74","Main hazards":"Toxic","R-phrases (outdated)":"R11, R23, R24, R25.","NFPA 704":"3\n3","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"168 mg/kg (rat, oral)[2]","Other anions":"Ammonium sulfate","Other cations":"Sodium hydrosulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
