{"name":"Cadmium sulfide","desc":"Cadmium sulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula CdS. Cadmium sulfide is a yellow solid. It occurs in nature with two different crystal structures as the rare minerals greenockite and hawleyite, but is more prevalent as an impurity substituent in the similarly structured zinc ores sphalerite and wurtzite, which are the major economic sources of cadmium. As a compound that is easy to isolate and purify, it is the principal source of cadmium for all commercial applications. Its vivid yellow color led to its adoption as a pigment for the yellow paint \"cadmium yellow\" in the 18th century.","images":[{"alt":"3D model of the structure of hawleyite","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Hawleyite-3D-balls.png/100px-Hawleyite-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"Cadmium sulfide.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cadmium_sulfide.jpg/200px-Cadmium_sulfide.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Cadmium_sulfide","":"","GreenockiteHawleyite":"Cadmium(II) sulfide,\nGreenockite\nHawleyite","CAS Number":"1306-23-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"7969586 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.771","EC Number":"215-147-8","PubChem CID":"14783","RTECS number":"EV3150000","UNII":"057EZR4Z7Q Y","UN number":"2570","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Cadmium\">Cd</span><span title=\"Sulfur\">S</span>","Molar mass":"144.47 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Yellow-orange to brown solid.","Density":"4.826 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid.","Melting point":"1,750 °C (3,180 °F; 2,020 K) 10 MPa","Boiling point":"980 °C (1,800 °F; 1,250 K) (sublimation)","Solubility in water":"insoluble[1]","Solubility":"soluble in acid\nvery slightly soluble in ammonium hydroxide","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-50.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"2.529","Crystal structure":"Hexagonal, Cubic","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"65 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−162 kJ·mol−1[2]","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0404","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Carc.
