{"name":"Ozone","desc":"Ozone /ˈoʊzoʊn/ (systematically named 1λ1,3λ1-trioxidane and catena-trioxygen), or trioxygen, is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O\n3. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O\n2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O\n2 or dioxygen. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light and also atmospheric electrical discharges, and is present in low concentrations throughout the Earth's atmosphere (stratosphere). In total, ozone makes up only 6993600000000000000♠0.6 ppm of the atmosphere.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of ozone with partial charges shown","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Ozone-1%2C3-dipole.png/200px-Ozone-1%2C3-dipole.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of ozone","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Ozone-CRC-MW-3D-balls.png/100px-Ozone-CRC-MW-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ozone","":"","IUPAC name":"Trioxygen","CAS Number":"10028-15-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:25812 Y","ChemSpider":"23208 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.051","EC Number":"233–069–2","Gmelin Reference":"1101","IUPHAR/BPS":"6297","MeSH":"Ozone","PubChem CID":"24823","RTECS number":"RS8225000","UNII":"66H7ZZK23N Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"48.00 g·mol−1","Appearance":"colorless to pale blue gas[1]","Odor":"pungent[1]","Density":"2.144 mg cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> (at 0&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−192.2 °C; −313.9 °F; 81.0 K","Boiling point":"−112 °C; −170 °F; 161 K","Solubility in water":"1.05 g L−1 (at 0 °C)","Solubility":"very soluble in CCl4, sulfuric acid","Vapor pressure":">1 atm (20 °C)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+6.7·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.2226 (liquid), 1.00052 (gas, STP, 546 nm — note high dispersion)[2]","Space group":"C2v","Coordination geometry":"Digonal","Molecular shape":"Dihedral","Hybridisation":"sp2 for O1","Dipole moment":"0.53 D","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"238.92 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"142.67 kJ mol−1","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"O  T+  C  Xi","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n4\nOX","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LCLo (lowest published)":"12.6 ppm (mouse, 3 hr)\n50 ppm (human, 30 min)\n36 ppm (rabbit, 3 hr)\n21 ppm (mouse, 3 hr)\n21.8 ppm (rat, 3 hr)\n24.8 ppm (guinea pig, 3 hr)\n4.8 ppm (rat, 4 hr)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.1 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"C 0.1 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"5 ppm[1]","Related compounds":"Sulfur dioxide\nTrisulfur\nDisulfur monoxide\nCyclic ozone","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
