{"name":"Gold(III) oxide","desc":"Gold(III) oxide (Au2O3) is the most stable oxide of gold. It is a red-brown, thermally unstable solid that decomposes at 160 °C. The hydrated form is weakly acidic and dissolves in concentrated alkali to form salts that are believed to contain the Au(OH)4− ion.","images":[{"alt":"Au2O3structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Au2O3structure.jpg/200px-Au2O3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Gold_trioxide","IUPAC name":"Gold(III) oxide","Other names":"Gold trioxide, Gold sesquioxide","CAS Number":"1303-58-8 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.748","PubChem CID":"164805","Chemical formula":"Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"441.93","Appearance":"red-brown solid","Density":"11.34 g/cm<sup>3</sup> at 20 &#xB0;C<sup id=\"cite_ref-struct_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-struct-1\">[1]</a></sup>","Melting point":"160 °C (320 °F; 433 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"insoluble in water, soluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid","Crystal structure":"Orthorombic, oF40","Space group":"Fdd2, No. 43[1]","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
