{"name":"1,2-Dichloroethane","desc":"The chemical compound 1,2-dichloroethane commonly known as ethylene dichloride (EDC), is a chlorinated hydrocarbon. It is a colourless liquid with a chloroform-like odour. The most common use of 1,2-dichloroethane is in the production of vinyl chloride, which is used to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, furniture and automobile upholstery, wall coverings, housewares, and automobile parts.1,2-Dichloroethane is also used generally as an intermediate for other organic chemical compounds and as a solvent. It forms azeotropes with many other solvents, including water (b.p. 70.5 °C) and other chlorocarbons.","images":[{"alt":"1,2-Dichloroethane","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/1%2C2-dichloroethane.svg/100px-1%2C2-dichloroethane.svg.png"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ethylene_dichloride","":"","IUPAC name":"1,2-Dichloroethane","Other names":"Ethylene dichloride\nDCE\nDCA\nEthane dichloride\nDutch liquid, Dutch oil\nFreon 150","CAS Number":"107-06-2 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:27789 N","ChemSpider":"13837650 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.003.145","KEGG":"C06752 Y","PubChem CID":"11","RTECS number":"KI0525000","UNII":"55163IJI47 Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Chlorine\">Cl</span><sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"98.95 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless liquid","Odor":"characteristic, pleasant chloroform-like odor[1]","Density":"1.253&#xA0;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, liquid","Melting point":"−35 °C (−31 °F; 238 K)","Boiling point":"84 °C (183 °F; 357 K)","Solubility in water":"0.87 g/100 mL (20 °C)","Viscosity":"0.84 mPa·s at 20 °C","Dipole moment":"1.80 D","Main hazards":"Toxic, flammable, carcinogenic","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","R-phrases (outdated)":"R11 R45 R36/37/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S45 S53","NFPA 704":"3\n3\n0","Flash point":"13 °C (55 °F; 286 K)","Explosive limits":"6.2%-16%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"3000 ppm (guinea pig, 7 hr)\n1000 ppm (rat, 7 hr)[2]","LCLo (lowest published)":"1217 ppm (mouse, 2 hr)\n1000 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n3000 ppm (rabbit, 7 hr)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 50 ppm C 100 ppm 200 ppm [5-minute maximum peak in any 3 hours][1]","REL (Recommended)":"Ca TWA 1 ppm (4 mg/m3) ST 2 ppm (8 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"Ca [50 ppm][1]","Related haloalkanes":"Methyl chloride\nMethylene chloride\n1,1,1-Trichloroethane","Related compounds":"Ethylene\nChlorine\nVinyl chloride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
