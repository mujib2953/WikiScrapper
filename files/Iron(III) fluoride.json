{"name":"Iron(III) fluoride","desc":"Iron(III) fluoride, also known as ferric fluoride, is an inorganic compound. It exists in an anhydrous form (formula FeF3) as well as two hydrated forms (both formula FeF3·3H2O). It is produced commercially mostly for laboratory work and is not as useful as the related compound iron(III) chloride. Anhydrous iron(III) fluoride is white while the hydrated forms are light pink.","images":[{"alt":"Aluminium-trifluoride-3D-polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Aluminium-trifluoride-3D-polyhedra.png/200px-Aluminium-trifluoride-3D-polyhedra.png"},{"alt":"FeF3structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/FeF3structure.jpg/200px-FeF3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Iron_trifluoride","Other names":"iron trifluoride, ferric fluoride","CAS Number":"7783-50-8 N\n15469-38-2 (trihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22958 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.093","PubChem CID":"24552","RTECS number":"NO6865000","Chemical formula":"FeF<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"112.840 g/mol (anhydrous)\n166.89 g/mol (trihydrate)","Appearance":"pale green crystals","Density":"3.87 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (trihydrate)","Melting point":"> 1,000 °C (1,830 °F; 1,270 K)","Solubility in water":"slightly soluble (anhydrous)\n49.5 g/100 mL (trihydrate)","Solubility":"negligible in alcohol, ether, benzene","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+13,760·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Rhombohedral, hR24","Space group":"R-3c, No. 167","Other anions":"iron(III) oxide, iron(III) chloride","Other cations":"manganese trifluoride, cobalt trifluoride, ruthenium(III) fluoride","Related compounds":"iron(II) fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
