{"name":"Caesium oxide","desc":"Caesium oxide (IUPAC name) or cesium oxide describes inorganic compounds composed of caesium and oxygen. The following binary (containing only Cs and O) oxides of caesium are known: Cs11O3, Cs4O, Cs7O, and Cs2O. Both the oxide and suboxides are brightly coloured. The species Cs2O forms yellow-orange hexagonal crystals.","images":[{"alt":"Caesium oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Caesium-oxide-xtal-3D-SF.png/200px-Caesium-oxide-xtal-3D-SF.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Caesium_oxide","IUPAC name":"Caesium oxide","US":"Cesium oxide (US)","CAS Number":"20281-00-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8079519 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.693","EC Number":"243-679-0","PubChem CID":"9903865","Chemical formula":"Cs<sub>2</sub>O","Molar mass":"281.81 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow-orange solid","Density":"4.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"490 °C (914 °F; 763 K) (under N2)","Solubility in water":"reacts violently to form CsOH","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+1534.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"anti-CdCl2 (hexagonal)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"76.0 J K−1 mol−1","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"146.9 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-345.8 kJ/mol","Flash point":"non-flammable","Other anions":"Caesium hydroxide","Other cations":"Lithium oxide\nSodium oxide\nPotassium oxide\nRubidium oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
