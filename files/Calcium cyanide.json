{"name":"Calcium cyanide","desc":"Calcium cyanide also known as black cyanide, is an inorganic compound with the formula Ca(CN)2. It is a white solid, although it is rarely observed in pure form. Commercial samples can be black-gray. It is the calcium salt of cyanide. It hydrolyses readily (even on moist air) to release hydrogen cyanide. Like other similar cyanides it is very toxic.","images":[{"alt":"Calcium cyanide structure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Calcium_cyanide_structure.svg/150px-Calcium_cyanide_structure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_cyanide","IUPAC name":"calcium dicyanide","Systematic IUPAC name":"calcium dicyanide\ncalcium dicyanide","CAS Number":"592-01-8","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"11102","ECHA InfoCard":"100.008.856","EC Number":"209-740-0","PubChem CID":"11590","Chemical formula":"Ca(CN)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"92.1128 g/mol","Appearance":"white powder","Odor":"hydrogen cyanide","Density":"1.853 (20 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"640 °C (1,184 °F; 913 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"soluble","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, weak acids","Crystal structure":"rhombohedric","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Autoignition\ntemperature":"Non-flammable"}
