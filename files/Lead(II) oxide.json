{"name":"Lead(II) oxide","desc":"Lead(II) oxide, also called lead monoxide, is the inorganic compound with the molecular formula PbO. PbO occurs in two polymorphs: litharge having a tetragonal crystal structure, and massicot having an orthorhombic crystal structure. Modern applications for PbO are mostly in lead-based industrial glass and industrial ceramics, including computer components. It is an amphoteric oxide.","images":[{"alt":"Oxid olovnatý.JPG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Oxid_olovnat%C3%BD.JPG/244px-Oxid_olovnat%C3%BD.JPG"},{"alt":"PbO structure.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/PbO_structure.png/180px-PbO_structure.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Lead(II)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Lead(II) oxide","LithargeMassicot":"Lead monoxide\nLitharge\nMassicot\nPlumbous oxide","CAS Number":"1317-36-8 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.880","PubChem CID":"14827","RTECS number":"OG1750000","UN number":"3288","Chemical formula":"PbO","Molar mass":"223.20 g/mol","Appearance":"red or yellow powder","Density":"9.53 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"888 °C (1,630 °F; 1,161 K)","Boiling point":"1,477 °C (2,691 °F; 1,750 K)","Solubility in water":"0.017 g/L[1]","Solubility":"insoluble in dilute alkalis, alcohol\nsoluble in concentrated alkalis\nsoluble in HCl, ammonium chloride","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"6995420000000000000♠42.0×10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"tetragonal, tP4","Space group":"P4/nmm, No. 129","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0288","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Repr.
