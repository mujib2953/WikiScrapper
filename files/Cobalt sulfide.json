{"name":"Cobalt sulfide","desc":"Cobalt sulfide is the name for chemical compounds with a formula CoxSy. Well-characterized species include minerals with the formula CoS, CoS2, Co3S4, and the synthetic material Co9S8. In combination with molybdenum, the sulfides of cobalt are used as catalysts for the industrial process called hydrodesulfurization, which is implemented on a large scale in refineries. Cobalt sulfide thin films can be used as counter electrodes (CEs) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Several research works demonstrate that CoxSy can be used to substitute the high expensive platinum (Pt), commonly used for the preparation of high efficient CEs. Thin films of CoxSy can be deposited on different substrates using chemical precursor Inks based on organic solvents  or water. Also electrochemical techniques are suitable for the preparation of efficient and cheap CoxSy CEs. It has been demonstrated that CoS CEs can be also used in p-type DSSCs.","images":[{"alt":"Sulfid kobaltnatý.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Sulfid_kobaltnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Sulfid_kobaltnat%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Cobalt(II)_sulfide","CAS Number":"1317-42-6 Y","PubChem CID":"14832","RTECS number":"GG332500","Chemical formula":"CoS (varied)","Molar mass":"90.9982 g/mol","Appearance":"black solid (alpha)\ngrayish-red crystals (beta)","Density":"5.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1195 °C","Solubility in water":"0.00038 g/100 mL (18 °C)","Solubility":"slightly soluble in acid","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+225.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"octahedral (beta)","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
