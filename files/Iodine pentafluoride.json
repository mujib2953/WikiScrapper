{"name":"Iodine pentafluoride","desc":"Iodine pentafluoride is an interhalogen compound with chemical formula IF5. It is a fluoride of iodine. It is a colorless or yellow liquid with a density of 3.250 g cm−3. It was first synthesized by Henri Moissan in 1891 by burning solid iodine in fluorine gas. This exothermic reaction is still used to produce iodine pentafluoride, although the reaction conditions have been improved.","images":[{"alt":"Stereo structural formula of iodine pentafluoride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Iodine-pentafluoride-gas-2D-dimensions.png/100px-Iodine-pentafluoride-gas-2D-dimensions.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Iodine_pentafluoride","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Iodine(V) fluoride\nIodine(V) fluoride","Systematic IUPAC name":"Pentafluoro-λ5-iodane\nPentafluoro-λ5-iodane","Other names":"Iodic fluoride","CAS Number":"7783-66-6 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"455940 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.108","EC Number":"232-019-7","PubChem CID":"522683","Chemical formula":"IF<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"221.89 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless or pale yellow liquid","Density":"3.250 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"9.43 °C (48.97 °F; 282.58 K)","Boiling point":"97.85 °C (208.13 °F; 371.00 K)","Solubility in water":"Reacts[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−58.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"monoclinic\npoint group C2/c","Coordination geometry":"square pyramidal","Molecular shape":"square pyramidal[2]","Main hazards":"Toxic, oxidizing, corrosive.","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","GHS pictograms":"","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H271, H330, H311, H301, H314, H371, H410[3]","GHS precautionary statements":"P202, P232, P304, P310[3]","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n2\nW","Other anions":"Iodine pentoxide","Other cations":"Bromine pentafluoride","Related compounds":"Iodine monofluoride\nIodine trifluoride\nIodine heptafluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
