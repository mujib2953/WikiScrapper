{"name":"Arsine","desc":"Arsine is an inorganic compound with the formula AsH3. This flammable, pyrophoric, and highly toxic pnictogen hydride gas is one of the simplest compounds of arsenic. Despite its lethality, it finds some applications in the semiconductor industry and for the synthesis of organoarsenic compounds. The term arsine is commonly used to describe a class of organoarsenic compounds of the formula AsH3−xRx, where R = aryl or alkyl. For example, As(C6H5)3, called triphenylarsine, is referred to as \"an arsine.\"","images":[{"alt":"Arsine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Arsine.png/130px-Arsine.png"},{"alt":"Arsine-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Arsine-3D-balls.png/120px-Arsine-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Arsine","":"","IUPAC names":"Arsenic trihydride\nArsane\nTrihydridoarsenic","Other names":"Arseniuretted hydrogen,\nArsenous hydride,\nhydrogen arsenide\nArsenic hydride","CAS Number":"7784-42-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:47217 Y","ChemSpider":"22408 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.151","EC Number":"232-066-3","Gmelin Reference":"599","PubChem CID":"23969","Chemical formula":"AsH<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"77.9454 g/mol","Appearance":"colourless gas","Density":"4.93 g/l, gas; 1.640 g/mL (&#x2212;64&#xA0;&#xB0;C)","Melting point":"−111.2 °C (−168.2 °F; 162.0 K)","Boiling point":"−62.5 °C (−80.5 °F; 210.7 K)","Solubility in water":"0.07 g/100 ml (25 °C)","Vapor pressure":"14.9 atm[1]","Molecular shape":"trigonal pyramidal","Dipole moment":"0.20 D","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"223 J.K−1.mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"+66.4 kJ/mol","Main hazards":"explosive, flammable, potential occupational carcinogen[1]","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Extremely flammable (F+)\nHighly toxic (T+)\nHarmful (Xn)\nDangerous for the environment (N)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R12, R26, R48/20, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S9, S16, S28, S33, S36/37, S45, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"4\n4\n2","Flash point":"−62 °C (−80 °F; 211 K)","Explosive limits":"5.1%-78%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"2.5mg/kg(Intravenous)[2]","LC50 (median concentration)":"120 ppm (rat, 10 min)\n77 ppm (mouse, 10 min)\n201 ppm (rabbit, 10 min)\n108 ppm (dog, 10 min)[3]","LCLo (lowest published)":"250 ppm (human, 30 min)\n300 ppm (human, 5 min)\n25 ppm (human, 30 min)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.05 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"C 0.002 mg/m3 [15-minute][1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"3 ppm[1]","Related hydrides":"Ammonia; Phosphine; Stibine; Bismuthine","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
