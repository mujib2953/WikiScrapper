{"name":"Tin(II) chloride","desc":"Tin(II) chloride, also known as stannous chloride, is a white crystalline solid with the formula SnCl2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride should not be confused with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl4).","images":[{"alt":"Tin(II) chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Tin%28II%29_chloride.jpg/200px-Tin%28II%29_chloride.jpg"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tin(II)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Tin(II) chloride\nTin dichloride","Other names":"Stannous chloride\nTin salt\nTin protochloride","CAS Number":"7772-99-8 Y\n10025-69-1 (dihydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:78067 N","ChemSpider":"22887 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.133.348","E number":"E512 (acidity regulators, ...)","PubChem CID":"24479","RTECS number":"XP8700000 (anhydrous)\nXP8850000 (dihydrate)","UN number":"3260","Chemical formula":"SnCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"189.60 g/mol (anhydrous)\n225.63 g/mol (dihydrate)","Appearance":"White crystalline solid","Odor":"odorless","Density":"3.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.71 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (dihydrate)","Melting point":"247 °C (477 °F; 520 K) (anhydrous)\n37.7 °C (dihydrate)","Boiling point":"623 °C (1,153 °F; 896 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"83.9 g/100 ml (0 °C)\nHydrolyses in hot water","Solubility":"soluble in ethanol, acetone, ether, Tetrahydrofuran\ninsoluble in xylene","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−69.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Layer structure\n(chains of SnCl3 groups)","Coordination geometry":"Trigonal pyramidal (anhydrous)\nDihydrate also three-coordinate","Molecular shape":"Bent (gas phase)","Main hazards":"Irritant, dangerous for aquatic organisms","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nICSC 0955 (anhydrous)\nICSC 0783 (dihydrate)","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"700 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n10,000 mg/kg (rabbit, oral)\n250 mg/kg (mouse, oral)[1]","Other anions":"Tin(II) fluoride\nTin(II) bromide\nTin(II) iodide","Other cations":"Germanium dichloride\nTin(IV) chloride\nLead(II) chloride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
