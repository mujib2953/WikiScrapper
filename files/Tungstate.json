{"name":"Tungstate","desc":"In chemistry, a tungstate is a compound that contains an oxoanion of tungsten or is a mixed oxide containing tungsten. The simplest tungstate ion is WO2âˆ’\n4, \"orthotungstate\". Many other tungstates belong to a large group of polyatomic ions that are termed polyoxometalates, (\"POMs\"), and specifically termed isopolyoxometalates as they contain, along with oxygen and maybe hydrogen, only one other element. Almost all useful tungsten ores are tungstates.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Tungstate"}
