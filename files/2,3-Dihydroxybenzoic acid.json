{"name":"2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid","desc":"2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid is a natural phenol found in Phyllanthus acidus and in the aquatic fern Salvinia molesta. It is also abundant in the fruits of Flacourtia inermis. It is a dihydroxybenzoic acid, a type of organic compound. The colorless solid occurs naturally, being formed via the shikimate pathway. It is incorporated into various siderophores, which are molecules that strongly complex iron ions for absorption into bacteria. 2,3-DHB consists of a catechol group, which upon deprotonation binds iron centers very strongly, and the carboxylic acid group by which the ring attaches to various scaffolds via amide linkages. A famous high affinity siderophore is enterochelin, which contains three dihydroxybenzoyl substituents linked to the depsipeptide of serine.","images":[{"alt":"2,3-Dihydroxybenzoesäure.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/2%2C3-Dihydroxybenzoes%C3%A4ure.svg/100px-2%2C3-Dihydroxybenzoes%C3%A4ure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/2,3-dihydroxybenzoic_acid","IUPAC name":"2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid","Other names":"Hypogallic acid; 2-Pyrocatechuic acid; o-Pyrocatechuic acid","CAS Number":"303-38-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","Abbreviations":"2,3-DHBA; 2,3-DHB","ChEBI":"CHEBI:18026 Y","ChemSpider":"18 Y","DrugBank":"DB01672 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.582","KEGG":"C00196 Y","PubChem CID":"19","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>7</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"154.12 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless solid","Melting point":"204 to 206 °C (399 to 403 °F; 477 to 479 K)","Solubility in water":"26 g/L at 22C","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
