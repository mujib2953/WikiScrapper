{"name":"Sulfate","desc":"The sulfate or sulphate (see spelling differences) ion is a polyatomic anion with the empirical formula SO2−\n4. Sulfate is the spelling recommended by IUPAC, but sulphate is used in British English. Salts, acid derivatives, and peroxides of sulfate are widely used in industry. Sulfates occur widely in everyday life. Sulfates are salts of sulfuric acid and many are prepared from that acid.","images":[{"alt":"The structure and bonding of the sulfate ion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Sulfate-ion-2D-dimensions.png/170px-Sulfate-ion-2D-dimensions.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the sulfate anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Sulfate-3D-vdW.png/100px-Sulfate-3D-vdW.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sulfate","":"","Systematic IUPAC name":"Sulfate\nSulfate","CAS Number":"14808-79-8","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:16189","ChemSpider":"1085","ECHA InfoCard":"100.108.048","EC Number":"233-334-2","PubChem CID":"1117","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">SO<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\">2&#x2212;<br>\n4</span></span>","Molar mass":"96.06 g·mol−1"}
