{"name":"Rubidium oxide","desc":"Rubidium oxide is the chemical compound with the formula Rb2O. Rubidium oxide is highly reactive towards water, and therefore it would not be expected to occur naturally. The rubidium content in minerals is often calculated and quoted in terms of Rb2O. In reality, the rubidium is typically present as a component of (actually, an impurity in) silicate or aluminosilicate. A major source of rubidium is lepidolite, KLi2Al(Al,Si)3O10(F,OH)2, wherein Rb sometimes replaces K.","images":[{"alt":"Rubidium-oxide-xtal-3D-vdW-B.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rubidium-oxide-xtal-3D-vdW-B.png/200px-Rubidium-oxide-xtal-3D-vdW-B.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Rubidium_oxide","IUPAC name":"Rubidium oxide","Other names":"Rubidium(I) oxide\nDirubidium oxide","CAS Number":"18088-11-4 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.038.161","Chemical formula":"Rb<sub>2</sub>O","Molar mass":"186.94 g/moL","Appearance":"Yellow solid","Density":"4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":">500 °C","Solubility in water":"Reacts violently to give RbOH","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+1527.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Antifluorite (cubic), cF12","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (Rb+); cubic (O2−)","Main hazards":"Corrosive, reacts violently with water","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other cations":"Lithium oxide\nSodium oxide\nPotassium oxide\nCaesium oxide","Related rubidium oxides":"Rubidium suboxide\nRubidium peroxide\nRubidium superoxide","Related compounds":"Rubidium hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
