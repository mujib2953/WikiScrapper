{"name":"Germanium monoxide","desc":"Germanium monoxide, GeO, is a chemical compound of germanium and oxygen. It can be prepared as a yellow sublimate at 1000 °C by reacting GeO2 with Ge metal. The yellow sublimate turns brown on heating at 650 °C. GeO is not well characterised. It is amphoteric dissolving in acids to form germanium(II) salts and in alkali to form \"trihydroxogermanates\" or \"germanites\" containing the Ge(OH)3− ion.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Germanium(II)_oxide","IUPAC name":"germanium(II) oxide","Other names":"germanous oxide\ngermanous acid","CAS Number":"20619-16-3 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.914","PubChem CID":"6327639","Chemical formula":"GeO","Molar mass":"88.6394 g/mol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−28.8·10−6 cm3/mol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
