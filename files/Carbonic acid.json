{"name":"Carbonic acid","desc":"Carbonic acid is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H2CO3 (equivalently OC(OH)2). It is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water (carbonated water), because such solutions contain small amounts of H2CO3. In physiology, carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid, because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs. It plays an important role in the bicarbonate buffer system to maintain acid–base homeostasis.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Carbonic-acid-2D.svg/100px-Carbonic-acid-2D.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Carbonic_acid","":"","Preferred IUPAC name[1]":"Carbonic acid[1]\nCarbonic acid[1]","Other names":"Carbon dioxide solution\nDihydrogen carbonate\nAcid of air\nAerial acid\nHydroxymethanoic acid","CAS Number":"463-79-6 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28976 Y","ChemSpider":"747 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.133.015","KEGG":"C01353 Y","Chemical formula":"H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"62.03 g/mol","Density":"1.668 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Solubility in water":"Only stable in solution","Acidity (pKa)":"3.6 (pKa1 for H2CO3 only), 6.3 (pKa1 including CO2(aq)), 10.32 (pKa2)","Related compounds":"Acetone\nUrea\nCarbonyl fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
