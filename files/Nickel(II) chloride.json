{"name":"Nickel(II) chloride","desc":"Nickel(II) chloride (or just nickel chloride), is the chemical compound NiCl2. The anhydrous salt is yellow, but the more familiar hydrate NiCl2·6H2O is green. Nickel(II) chloride, in various forms, is the most important source of nickel for chemical synthesis. The nickel chlorides are deliquescent, absorbing moisture from the air to form a solution. Nickel salts have been shown to be carcinogenic to the lungs and nasal passages, in cases of long-term inhalation exposure.","images":[{"alt":"Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Nickel%28II%29-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg/200px-Nickel%28II%29-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg"},{"alt":"MCl2(aq)6forFeCoNi.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/MCl2%28aq%296forFeCoNi.png/200px-MCl2%28aq%296forFeCoNi.png"},{"alt":"Anhydrous Nickel(II)-chloride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Anhydrous_Nickel%28II%29-chloride.jpg/200px-Anhydrous_Nickel%28II%29-chloride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Nickel(II)_chloride","IUPAC name":"Nickel(II) chloride","Other names":"Nickelous chloride, nickel(II) salt of hydrochloric acid","CAS Number":"7718-54-9 Y\n7791-20-0 (hexahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:34887 Y","ChemSpider":"22796 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.858","EC Number":"231-743-0","KEGG":"C14711 Y","PubChem CID":"24385","RTECS number":"QR6480000","Chemical formula":"NiCl<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"129.5994 g/mol (anhydrous)\n237.69 g/mol (hexahydrate)","Appearance":"yellow-brown crystals\ndeliquescent (anhydrous)\ngreen crystals (hexahydrate)","Odor":"odorless","Density":"3.55 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n1.92 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)","Melting point":"1,001 °C (1,834 °F; 1,274 K) (anhydrous)\n140 °C (hexahydrate)","Solubility in water":"anhydrous\n67.5 g/100 mL (25 °C) [1]\n87.6 g/100 mL (100 °C)\n\nhexahydrate\n123.8 g/100 mL (25 °C) [1]\n160.7 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility":"0.8 g/100 mL (hydrazine)\nsoluble in ethylene glycol, ethanol, ammonium hydroxide\ninsoluble in ammonia, nitric acid","Acidity (pKa)":"4 (hexahydrate)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+6145.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic","Coordination geometry":"octahedral at Ni","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"107 J·mol−1·K−1[2]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−316 kJ·mol−1[2]","Safety data sheet":"Fischer Scientific","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Carc.
