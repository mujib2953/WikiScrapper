{"name":"Carbon monoxide","desc":"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of carbon monoxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Carbon-monoxide-3D-balls.png/100px-Carbon-monoxide-3D-balls.png"},{"alt":"model of carbon monoxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Carbon_monoxide_2D.svg/170px-Carbon_monoxide_2D.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Carbon_monoxide","":"","Preferred IUPAC name":"Carbon monoxide\nCarbon monoxide","Other names":"Carbon monooxide\nCarbonous oxide\nCarbon(II) oxide\nCarbonyl\nFlue gas\nMonoxide","CAS Number":"630-08-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","Beilstein Reference":"3587264","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17245 Y","ChemSpider":"275 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.010.118","EC Number":"211-128-3","Gmelin Reference":"421","KEGG":"D09706 Y","MeSH":"Carbon+monoxide","PubChem CID":"281","RTECS number":"FG3500000","UNII":"7U1EE4V452 Y","UN number":"1016","Chemical formula":"CO","Molar mass":"28.010 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless gas","Odor":"odorless","Density":"789&#xA0;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, liquid<br>\n1.250&#xA0;kg/m<sup>3</sup> at 0&#xA0;&#xB0;C, 1&#xA0;atm<br>\n1.145&#xA0;kg/m<sup>3</sup> at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C, 1&#xA0;atm","Melting point":"−205.02 °C (−337.04 °F; 68.13 K)","Boiling point":"−191.5 °C (−312.7 °F; 81.6 K)","Solubility in water":"27.6 mg/L (25 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in chloroform, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, ethanol, ammonium hydroxide, benzene","Henry's law\nconstant (kH)":"1.04 atm-m3/mol","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-9.8·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.0003364","Dipole moment":"0.122 D","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"29.1 J/K mol","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"197.7 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−110.5 kJ·mol−1","Std enthalpy of\ncombustion (ΔcHo298)":"−283.4 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nICSC 0023","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"F  T+","R-phrases (outdated)":"R61 R12 R26 R48/23","S-phrases (outdated)":"S53 S45","NFPA 704":"[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n0","Flash point":"−191 °C (−311.8 °F; 82.1 K)","Autoignition\ntemperature":"609 °C (1,128 °F; 882 K)","Explosive limits":"12.5–74.2%","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"8636 ppm (rat, 15 min)\n5207 ppm (rat, 30 min)\n1784 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n2414 ppm (mouse, 4 hr)\n5647 ppm (guinea pig, 4 hr)[1]","LCLo (lowest published)":"4000 ppm (human, 30 min)\n5000 ppm (human, 5 min)[1]","NIOSH[3]":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 50 ppm (55 mg/m3)","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 35 ppm (40 mg/m3) C 200 ppm (229 mg/m3)","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"1200 ppm","Related carbon oxides":"Carbon dioxide\nCarbon suboxide\nOxocarbons","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
