{"name":"Carbamic acid","desc":"Carbamic acid is the compound with the formula NH2COOH. The attachment of the acid group to a nitrogen or amine (instead of carbon) distinguishes it from carboxylic acid and an amide. Many derivatives and analogues of carbamic acid are known. They are generally unstable, reverting to the parent amine and carbon dioxide. The deprotonated anion (or conjugate base) of this functional group is a carbamate. Carbamic acid is a planar molecule.","images":[{"alt":"Structural formula of carbamic acid","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Carbamins%C3%A4ure.svg/100px-Carbamins%C3%A4ure.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Carbamic_acid","":"","IUPAC name":"Carbamic acid","Other names":"Aminomethanoic Acid","CAS Number":"463-77-4 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:28616 Y","ChemSpider":"271 Y","DrugBank":"DB04261 Y","KEGG":"C01563 Y","MeSH":"Carbamic+acid","PubChem CID":"277","Chemical formula":"CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"61.040 g/mol","Related compounds":"Formamide\nDithiocarbamate\nCarbonic acid\nUrea\nEthyl carbamate\nGlycine","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
