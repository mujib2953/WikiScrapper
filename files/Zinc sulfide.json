{"name":"Zinc sulfide","desc":"Zinc sulfide (or zinc sulphide) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula of ZnS. This is the main form of zinc found in nature, where it mainly occurs as the mineral sphalerite. Although this mineral is usually black because of various impurities, the pure material is white, and it is widely used as a pigment. In its dense synthetic form, zinc sulfide can be transparent, and it is used as a window for visible optics and infrared optics.","images":[{"alt":"ZnS powders2.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/ZnS_powders2.jpg/250px-ZnS_powders2.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_sulfide","ZincblendeWurtzite":"Zincblende\nWurtzite","CAS Number":"1314-98-3 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.866","PubChem CID":"14821","RTECS number":"ZH5400000","Chemical formula":"ZnS","Molar mass":"97.474 g/mol","Density":"4.090 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,850 °C (3,360 °F; 2,120 K) (sublime)","Solubility in water":"negligible","Band gap":"3.54 eV (cubic, 300 K)\n3.91 eV (hexagonal, 300 K)","Crystal structure":"see text","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (Zn2+)\nTetrahedral (S2−)","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−204.6 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1627","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Zinc oxide\nZinc selenide\nZinc telluride","Other cations":"Cadmium sulfide\nMercury sulfide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
