{"name":"Niobium(V) chloride","desc":"Niobium(V) chloride, also known as niobium pentachloride, is a yellow crystalline solid. It hydrolyzes in air, and samples are often contaminated with small amounts of NbOCl3. It is often used as a precursor to other compounds of niobium. NbCl5 may be purified by sublimation.","images":[{"alt":"Sample of niobium(V) chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Niobium_pentachloride_solid.jpg/200px-Niobium_pentachloride_solid.jpg"},{"alt":"Niobium-pentachloride-dimer-2D.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Niobium-pentachloride-dimer-2D.png/200px-Niobium-pentachloride-dimer-2D.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Niobium(V)_chloride","IUPAC names":"Niobium(V) chloride\nNiobium pentachloride","CAS Number":"10026-12-7 NbCl5 N\n17499-28-4 Nb2Cl10 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.042","EC Number":"233-059-8","PubChem CID":"24818","RTECS number":"QU0350000","UNII":"9S1BC7865F N","Chemical formula":"NbCl<sub>5</sub>","Molar mass":"270.17 g/mol","Appearance":"yellow monoclinic crystals\ndeliquescent","Density":"2.75 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"204.7 °C (400.5 °F; 477.8 K)","Boiling point":"248.2 °C (478.8 °F; 521.3 K)","Solubility in water":"decomposes","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, HCl, chloroform, CCl4","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"214.05 J K−1 mol−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-797.47 kJ/mol","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Niobium(V) fluoride\nNiobium(V) bromide\nNiobium(V) iodide","Other cations":"Vanadium(IV) chloride\nTantalum(V) chloride","Related niobium chlorides":"Niobium(III) chloride\nNiobium(IV) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
