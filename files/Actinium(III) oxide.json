{"name":"Actinium(III) oxide","desc":"Actinium(III) oxide is a chemical compound containing the rare radioactive element actinium. It has the formula Ac2O3. It is similar to its corresponding lanthanum compound, lanthanum(III) oxide, and contains actinium in the oxidation state +3. Actinium oxide is not to be confused with Ac2O (acetic anhydride), where Ac is an abbreviation for acetyl instead of the symbol of the element actinium.","images":[{"alt":"Actinium sesquioxide.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Actinium_sesquioxide.jpg"},{"alt":"Unit cell, ball and stick model of actinium(III) oxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/La2O3structure.jpg/121px-La2O3structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Actinium(III)_oxide","IUPAC name":"Actinium(III) oxide","Systematic IUPAC name":"Actinium(3+) oxide\nActinium(3+) oxide","Other names":"Actinium sesquioxide","CAS Number":"12002-61-8 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.031.275","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Actinium\">Ac</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"502.00 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white","Crystal structure":"Trigonal, hP5","Space group":"P-3m1, No. 164","Other cations":"Scandium(III) oxide\nYttrium(III) oxide\nLanthanum(III) oxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
