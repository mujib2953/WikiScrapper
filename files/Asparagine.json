{"name":"Asparagine","desc":"Asparagine (abbreviated as Asn or N), encoded by the codons AAU and AAC, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+\n3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain carboxamide, classifying it as a polar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or other source of carbonyls produces acrylamide in food when heated to sufficient temperature. These products occur in baked goods such as French fries, potato chips, and toasted bread.","images":[{"alt":"Skeletal formula of L-asparagine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/L-Asparagin_-_L-Asparagine.svg/200px-L-Asparagin_-_L-Asparagine.svg.png"},{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the L-asparagine molecule as a zwitterion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/L-Asparagin_phys.svg/220px-L-Asparagin_phys.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Asparagine","IUPAC name":"Asparagine","Other names":"2-Amino-3-carbamoylpropanoic acid","CAS Number":"70-47-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image\nInteractive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:17196 Y","ChemSpider":"6031 Y","DrugBank":"DB03943 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.000.669","EC Number":"200-735-9","IUPHAR/BPS":"4533","KEGG":"C00152 Y","PubChem CID":"236","UNII":"7NG0A2TUHQ Y","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Carbon\">C</span><sub>4</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>8</sub><span title=\"Nitrogen\">N</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Oxygen\">O</span><sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"132.12 g·mol−1","Appearance":"white crystals","Density":"1.543 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"234 °C (453 °F; 507 K)","Boiling point":"438 °C (820 °F; 711 K)","Solubility in water":"2.94 g/100 mL","Solubility":"soluble in acids, bases, negligible in methanol, ethanol, ether, benzene","log P":"−3.82","Acidity (pKa)":"2.02 (carboxyl), 8.80 (amino)[1]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"-69.5·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"orthorhomic","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−789.4 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"See: data page\nSigma-Alrich","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"219 °C (426 °F; 492 K)","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
