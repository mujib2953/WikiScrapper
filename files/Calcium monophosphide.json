{"name":"Calcium monophosphide","desc":"Calcium monophosphide is the inorganic compound with the formula CaP. The term \"calcium phosphide\" also describes the composition Ca3P2, which is also called calcium phosphide. CaP and Ca3P2 are completely different materials. CaP is black, Ca3P2 is red-brown. The monophosphide decomposes to Ca3P2 at about 600 °C.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium-peroxide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Sodium-peroxide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Sodium-peroxide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Calcium_monophosphide","Other names":"Calcium phosphide","CAS Number":"39373-03-0 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.049.465","Chemical formula":"CaP (Ca<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>)","Appearance":"black solid","Solubility in water":"decomposes","R-phrases (outdated)":"R15/29 R28 R50","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2) S22 S43 S45 S61","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
