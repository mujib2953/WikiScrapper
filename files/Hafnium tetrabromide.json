{"name":"Hafnium tetrabromide","desc":"Hafnium tetrabromide is the inorganic compound with the formula HfBr4. It is the most common bromide of hafnium. It is a colorless, diamagnetic moisture sensitive solid that sublimes in vacuum. It adopts a structure very similar to that of zirconium tetrabromide, featuring tetrahedral Hf centers, in contrast to the polymeric nature of hafnium tetrachloride.","images":[{"alt":"Hafnium tetrabromide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Tin-tetraiodide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Tin-tetraiodide-unit-cell-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Hafnium(IV)_bromide","CAS Number":"13777-22-5","ECHA InfoCard":"100.034.001","Chemical formula":"Br<sub>4</sub>Hf","Appearance":"colorless solid","Density":"5.094 g/cm<sup>3</sup>"}
