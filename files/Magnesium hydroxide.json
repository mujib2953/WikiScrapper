{"name":"Magnesium hydroxide","desc":"Magnesium hydroxide is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula Mg(OH)2. It occurs in nature as the mineral brucite. It is a white solid with low solubility in water (Ksp = 5.61×10−12). Magnesium hydroxide is a common component of antacids, such as milk of magnesia, as well as laxatives.","images":[{"alt":"Magnesium hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Hydroxid_ho%C5%99e%C4%8Dnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Hydroxid_ho%C5%99e%C4%8Dnat%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"Magnesium hydroxide","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg/200px-Mg%28OH%292Xray.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Magnesium_hydroxide","IUPAC name":"Magnesium hydroxide","Other names":"Milk of magnesia","CAS Number":"1309-42-8 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:6637 Y","ChemSpider":"14107 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.792","EC Number":"215-170-3","E number":"E528 (acidity regulators, ...)","Gmelin Reference":"485572","PubChem CID":"14791","RTECS number":"OM3570000","UNII":"NBZ3QY004S Y","Chemical formula":"Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"58.3197 g/mol","Appearance":"White solid","Odor":"Odorless","Density":"2.3446<span class=\"nowrap\">&#xA0;</span>g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"350 °C (662 °F; 623 K) decomposes","Solubility in water":"0.00064 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n0.004 g/100 mL (100 °C)","Solubility product (Ksp)":"5.61×10−12","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−22.1·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.559[1]","Crystal structure":"Hexagonal, hP3[2]","Space group":"P3m1 No. 164","Lattice constant":"a = 0.312 nm, c = 0.473 nm","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"77.03 J/mol·K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"64 J·mol−1·K−1[3]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"−924.7 kJ·mol−1[3]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"−833.7 kJ/mol","ATC code":"A02AA04 (WHO) G04BX01 (WHO)","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"8500 mg/kg (rat, oral)","Other anions":"Magnesium oxide","Other cations":"Beryllium hydroxide\nCalcium hydroxide\nStrontium hydroxide\nBarium hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
