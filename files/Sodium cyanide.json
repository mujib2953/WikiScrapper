{"name":"Sodium cyanide","desc":"Sodium cyanide is an inorganic compound with the formula NaCN. It is a white, water-soluble solid. Cyanide has a high affinity for metals, which leads to the high toxicity of this salt. Its main application, in gold mining, also exploits its high reactivity toward metals. When it is treated with acid, it forms the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide:","images":[{"alt":"Sodium cyanide bonding","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Sodium_cyanide.svg/200px-Sodium_cyanide.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_cyanide","CAS Number":"143-33-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"8587 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.005.091","EC Number":"205-599-4","PubChem CID":"8929","RTECS number":"VZ7525000","UN number":"1689","Chemical formula":"NaCN","Molar mass":"49.0072 g/mol","Appearance":"white solid","Odor":"faint almond-like","Density":"1.5955 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"563.7 °C (1,046.7 °F; 836.9 K)","Boiling point":"1,496 °C (2,725 °F; 1,769 K)","Solubility in water":"48.15 g/100 mL (10 °C)\n63.7 g/100 mL (25 °C)","Solubility":"soluble in ammonia, methanol, ethanol\nvery slightly soluble in dimethylformamide, SO2\ninsoluble in dimethylsulphoxide","Refractive index (nD)":"1.452","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"70.4 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"115.7 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-91 kJ/mol","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 1118","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"T+  N  C [1]","R-phrases (outdated)":"R26/27/28, R32, R50/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S7, S28, S29, S45, S60, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n4\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LD50 (median dose)":"6.44 mg/kg (rat, oral)\n4 mg/kg (sheep, oral)\n15 mg/kg (mammal, oral)\n8 mg/kg (rat, oral)[3]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 5 mg/m3[2]","REL (Recommended)":"C 5 mg/m3 (4.7 ppm) [10-minute][2]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"25 mg/m3 (as CN)[2]","Other cations":"Potassium cyanide","Related compounds":"Hydrogen cyanide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
