{"name":"Silver(I) fluoride","desc":"Silver(I) fluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula AgF. It is one of the three main fluorides of silver, the others being silver subfluoride and silver(II) fluoride. AgF has relatively few niche applications; it has been employed as a fluorination and desilylation reagent in organic synthesis and in aqueous solution as a topical caries treatment in dentistry.","images":[{"alt":"Silver(I)-fluoride-3D-ionic.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Silver%28I%29-fluoride-3D-ionic.png/150px-Silver%28I%29-fluoride-3D-ionic.png"},{"alt":"Silver(I) fluoride.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Silver%28I%29_fluoride.jpg/200px-Silver%28I%29_fluoride.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Silver(I)_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Silver(I) fluoride","CAS Number":"7775-41-9 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.996","PubChem CID":"62656","RTECS number":"VW4250000","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Silver\">Ag</span><span title=\"Fluorine\">F</span>","Molar mass":"126.87 g·mol−1","Appearance":"yellow-brown solid","Density":"5.852 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (15 &#xB0;C)","Melting point":"435 °C (815 °F; 708 K)","Boiling point":"1,159 °C (2,118 °F; 1,432 K)","Solubility in water":"85.78 g/100 mL (0 °C)\n119.8 g/100 mL (10 °C)\n179.1 g/100 mL (25 °C)\n213.4 g/100 mL (50 °C)[1]","Solubility":"83g/100 g (11.9 °C) in hydrogen fluoride\n1.5g/100 mL in methanol(25 °C)[2]","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−36.5·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"cubic","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"48.1 J/mol·K[1]","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"83.7 J/mol·K[1]","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-206 kJ/mol[1]","Gibbs free energy (ΔfG˚)":"-187.9 kJ/mol[1]","Main hazards":"Corrosive","GHS pictograms":"[3]","GHS signal word":"Danger","GHS hazard statements":"H314","GHS precautionary statements":"P280, P305+351+338, P310","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n1\nOX","Other anions":"Silver(I) oxide\nSilver(I) chloride","Other cations":"Copper(I) fluoride\nGold(I) fluoride","Related compounds":"Silver subfluoride\nSilver(II) fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
