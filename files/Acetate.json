{"name":"Acetate","desc":"An acetate /ˈæsᵻteɪt/ is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base. \"Acetate\" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula C2H3O2−. The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a positive ion (called a cation) are also commonly called \"acetates\" (hence, acetate of lead, acetate of aluminum, etc.). The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CH3CO2−, or CH3COO−.","images":[{"alt":"Ball-and-stick model of the acetate anion","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Acetate-anion-3D-balls.png/200px-Acetate-anion-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Acetate_ion","IUPAC name":"Acetate","Systematic IUPAC name":"Ethanoate\nEthanoate","CAS Number":"71-50-1","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"170","PubChem CID":"175","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">C<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n2</span>H<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n3</span>O<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\">&#x2212;<br>\n2</span></span>","Molar mass":"59.04 g·mol−1"}
