{"name":"Tin(IV) chloride","desc":"Tin(IV) chloride, also known as tin tetrachloride or stannic chloride, is a inorganic compound with the formula SnCl4. At room temperature it is a colourless liquid, which fumes on contact with air, giving a stinging odor. It is used as a precursor to other tin compounds. It was first discovered by Andreas Libavius (1550–1616) and was known as spiritus fumans libavii.","images":[{"alt":"Tin (IV) chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Tin%28IV%29_chloride.jpg/100px-Tin%28IV%29_chloride.jpg"},{"alt":"Tin(IV)-chlorid.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Tin%28IV%29-chlorid.svg/100px-Tin%28IV%29-chlorid.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Tin(IV)_chloride","Anhydrous Tin(IV) chloride":"Tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate","":"","IUPAC names":"Tetrachlorostannane\nTin tetrachloride\nTin(IV) chloride","Other names":"Stannic chloride","CAS Number":"7646-78-8 Y\n10026-06-9 (pentahydrate) N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22707 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.028.717","EC Number":"231-588-9","PubChem CID":"24287","RTECS number":"XP8750000","UN number":"1827","Chemical formula":"SnCl<sub>4</sub>","Molar mass":"260.50 g/mol (anhydrous)\n350.60 g/mol (pentahydrate)","Appearance":"colorless to slightly yellow fuming liquid","Odor":"acrid","Density":"2.226 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.04 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (pentahydrate)","Melting point":"−34.07 °C (−29.33 °F; 239.08 K) (anhydrous)\n56 °C (133 °F; 329 K) (pentahydrate)","Boiling point":"114.15 °C (237.47 °F; 387.30 K)","Solubility in water":"decomposes (anhydrous)\nvery soluble (pentahydrate)","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol, benzene, toluene, chloroform, acetone, kerosene, CCl4, methanol, gasoline, CS2","Vapor pressure":"2.4 kPa","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−115·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.512","Crystal structure":"monoclinic (P21/c)","Safety data sheet":"ICSC 0953","EU classification (DSD) (outdated)":"Corrosive (C)","R-phrases (outdated)":"R34, R52/53","S-phrases (outdated)":"(S1/2), S7/8, S26, S45, S61","NFPA 704":"0\n3\n1","Other anions":"Tin(IV) fluoride\nTin(IV) bromide\nTin(IV) iodide","Other cations":"Carbon tetrachloride\nSilicon tetrachloride\nGermanium tetrachloride\nTin(II) chloride\nLead(IV) chloride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
