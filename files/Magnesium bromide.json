{"name":"Magnesium bromide","desc":"Magnesium bromide (MgBr2) is a chemical compound of magnesium and bromine that is white and deliquescent. It is often used as a mild sedative and as an anticonvulsant for treatment of nervous disorders. It is water-soluble and somewhat soluble in alcohol. It can be found naturally in small amounts in some minerals such as: bischofite and carnallite, and in sea water, such as that of the Dead Sea.","images":[{"alt":"Cadmium-iodide-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cadmium-iodide-3D-balls.png/200px-Cadmium-iodide-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Magnesium_bromide","CAS Number":"7789-48-2 (anhydrous) Y\n13446-53-2 (hexahydrate) N\n75198-45-7 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"74219 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.246","PubChem CID":"522691","UNII":"2VC6P60SLN Y","Chemical formula":"MgBr<sub>2</sub> (anhydrous)<br>\nMgBr<sub>2</sub>&#xB7;6H<sub>2</sub>O (hexahydrate)","Molar mass":"184.113 g/mol (anhydrous)\n292.204 g/mol (hexahydrate)","Appearance":"white hygroscopic hexagonal crystals (anhydrous) colorless monoclinic crystals (hexahydrate)","Density":"3.72 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (anhydrous)<br>\n2.07 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (hexahydrate)","Melting point":"711 °C (1,312 °F; 984 K) 172.4 °C, decomposes (hexahydrate)","Boiling point":"1,250 °C (2,280 °F; 1,520 K)","Solubility in water":"102 g/100 mL (anhydrous)\n316 g/100 mL (0 °C, hexahydrate)","Solubility":"ethanol: 6.9 g/100 mL\nmethanol: 21.8 g/100 mL","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−72.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Crystal structure":"Rhombohedral, hP3","Space group":"P-3m1, No. 164","Coordination geometry":"octahedral","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"70 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"117.2 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-524.3 kJ·mol−1","Safety data sheet":"External MSDS","NFPA 704":"0\n1\n0","Other anions":"magnesium fluoride\nmagnesium chloride\nmagnesium iodide","Other cations":"Beryllium bromide\nCalcium bromide\nStrontium bromide\nBarium bromide\nRadium bromide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
