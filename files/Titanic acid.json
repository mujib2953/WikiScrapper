{"name":"Titanic acid","desc":"Titanic acid is a general name for a family of chemical compounds of the elements titanium, hydrogen, and oxygen, with the general formula [TiOx(OH)4−2x]n. Various simple titanic acids have been claimed, mainly in the older literature. No crystallographic and little spectroscopic support exists for these materials. Some older literature including Brauer's Handbook refers to TiO2 as titanic acid.","images":[],"link":"/wiki/Titanic_acid","CAS Number":"20338-08-3 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"15640680 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.752","EC Number":"243-744-3","MeSH":"titanium+hydroxide","PubChem CID":"88494","Chemical formula":"<span class=\"chemf nowrap\">TiH<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n4</span>O<span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:1em;font-size:80%;text-align:left\"><br>\n4</span></span>","Molar mass":"115.896 g mol−1","Appearance":"White crystals"}
