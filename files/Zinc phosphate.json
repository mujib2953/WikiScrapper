{"name":"Zinc phosphate","desc":"Zinc phosphate (Zn3(PO4)2) is an inorganic chemical compound used as a corrosion resistant coating on metal surfaces either as part of an electroplating process or applied as a primer pigment (see also red lead). It has largely displaced toxic materials based on lead or chromium, and by 2006 it had become the most commonly used corrosion inhibitor. Zinc phosphate coats better on a crystalline structure than bare metal, so a seeding agent is often used as a pre-treatment. One common agent is sodium pyrophosphate.","images":[{"alt":"Zinc phosphate","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Fosfore%C4%8Dnan_zine%C4%8Dnat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Fosfore%C4%8Dnan_zine%C4%8Dnat%C3%BD.PNG"}],"link":"/wiki/Zinc_phosphate","IUPAC name":"Zinc phosphate","CAS Number":"7779-90-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22927 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.040","PubChem CID":"24519","RTECS number":"TD0590000","UNII":"1E2MCT2M62 Y","Chemical formula":"Zn<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"386.11 g/mol","Appearance":"white crystals","Density":"3.998 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"900 °C (1,650 °F; 1,170 K)","Solubility in water":"insoluble","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−141.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.595","Crystal structure":"monoclinic","NFPA 704":"0\n2\n0","Flash point":"Non-flammable","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
