{"name":"Diborane","desc":"Diborane is the chemical compound consisting of boron and hydrogen with the formula B2H6. It is a colorless, highly unstable and pyrophoric gas at room temperature with a repulsively sweet odor. Diborane mixes well with air, easily forming explosive mixtures. Diborane will ignite spontaneously in moist air at room temperature. Synonyms include boroethane, boron hydride, and diboron hexahydride.","images":[{"alt":"Stereo skeletal formula of diborane with all explicit hydrogens added and assorted measurements","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Diborane-2D.png/244px-Diborane-2D.png"},{"alt":"Ball and stick model of diborane","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Diborane-3D-balls-A.png/121px-Diborane-3D-balls-A.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Boron_hydride","IUPAC name":"Diborane(6)","Other names":"Boroethane\nBoron hydride\nDiboron hexahydride","CAS Number":"19287-45-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChEBI":"CHEBI:33590 Y","ChemSpider":"17215804 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.039.021","EC Number":"242-940-6","RTECS number":"HQ9275000","Chemical formula":"<span title=\"Boron\">B</span><sub>2</sub><span title=\"Hydrogen\">H</span><sub>6</sub>","Molar mass":"27.67 g·mol−1","Appearance":"Colorless gas","Odor":"repulsive and sweet","Density":"1.216 g/L","Melting point":"−164.85 °C (−264.73 °F; 108.30 K)","Boiling point":"−92.5 °C (−134.5 °F; 180.7 K)","Solubility in water":"Reacts[1]","Vapor pressure":"39.5 atm (16.6°C)[1]","Coordination geometry":"Tetrahedral (for boron)","Molecular shape":"see text","Dipole moment":"0 D","Main hazards":"highly flammable, reacts with water","Safety data sheet":"See: data page","NFPA 704":"[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n3\nW","Autoignition\ntemperature":"38 °C (100 °F; 311 K)","Explosive limits":"0.8%-88%[1]","Lethal dose or concentration (, ):":"","LC50 (median concentration)":"40 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n29 ppm (mouse, 4 hr)\n40-80 ppm (rat, 4 hr)\n159-181 ppm (rat, 15 min)[2]","LCLo (lowest published)":"125 ppm (dog, 2 hr)\n50 ppm (hamster, 8 hr)[2]","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.1 ppm (0.1 mg/m3)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.1 ppm (0.1 mg/m3)[1]","IDLH (Immediate danger)":"15 ppm[1]","Related boron compounds":"Decaborane\nBF3","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
