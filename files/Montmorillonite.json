{"name":"Montmorillonite","desc":"Montmorillonite is a very soft phyllosilicate group of minerals that form when they precipitate from water solution as microscopic crystals, known as clay. It is named after Montmorillon in France. Montmorillonite, a member of the smectite group, is a 2:1 clay, meaning that it has two tetrahedral sheets of silica sandwiching a central octahedral sheet of alumina. The particles are plate-shaped with an average diameter around 1 Î¼m and a thickness of 9.6 nm; magnification of about 25,000 times, using an electron microscope, is required to \"see\" individual clay particles. Members of this group include saponite.","images":[{"alt":"Montmorillonite-Quartz-pala48a.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Montmorillonite-Quartz-pala48a.jpg/240px-Montmorillonite-Quartz-pala48a.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Montmorillonite"}
