{"name":"Cyclopentadienyl anion","desc":"In chemistry, the cyclopentadienyl anion or cyclopentadienide is an aromatic species with a formula of [C5H5]− and abbreviated as Cp−. Its name derives from the molecule cyclopentadiene. Salts of the cyclopentadienyl anion can be stable, e.g., sodium cyclopentadienide. more complex coordination compounds are known as cyclopentadienyl complexes, such as metallocene","images":[{"alt":"Cyclopentadienyl-Anion.svg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Cyclopentadienyl-Anion.svg/100px-Cyclopentadienyl-Anion.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Cyclopentadienyl_anion","":"","CAS Number":"12127-83-2","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"2731064","PubChem CID":"3490527","Chemical formula":"[C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or Cp<sup>&#x2212;</sup>","Molar mass":"65.09 g/mol"}
