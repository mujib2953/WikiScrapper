{"name":"Ytterbium(III) chloride","desc":"Ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is an inorganic chemical compound. It reacts with NiCl2 to form a very effective catalyst for the reductive dehalogenation of aryl halides. It is poisonous if injected, and mildly toxic by ingestion. It is an experimental teratogen, known to irritate the skin and eyes. When heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of Cl−.","images":[{"alt":"Ytterbium(III) chloride","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Ytterbium%28III%29_chloride.jpg/200px-Ytterbium%28III%29_chloride.jpg"},{"alt":"Aluminium-trichloride-crystal-3D-balls.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Aluminium-trichloride-crystal-3D-balls.png/200px-Aluminium-trichloride-crystal-3D-balls.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Ytterbium(III)_chloride","IUPAC name":"Ytterbium(III) chloride","CAS Number":"19423-81-1 N","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"55430 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.030.715","Chemical formula":"YbCl<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"279.40 g/mol","Appearance":"White powder","Density":"4.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (solid)","Melting point":"854 °C (1,569 °F; 1,127 K)[1]","Boiling point":"1,453 °C (2,647 °F; 1,726 K)[1]","Solubility in water":"17 g/100 mL (25 °C)","Crystal structure":"Monoclinic, mS16","Space group":"C12/m1, No. 12","Other anions":"Ytterbium(III) oxide","Other cations":"Terbium(III) chloride, Lutetium(III) chloride","Structure and\nproperties":"Refractive index (n),\nDielectric constant (εr), etc.","Thermodynamic\ndata":"Phase behaviour\nsolid–liquid–gas","Spectral data":"UV, IR, NMR, MS","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
