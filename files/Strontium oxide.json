{"name":"Strontium oxide","desc":"Strontium oxide or strontia, SrO, is formed when strontium reacts with oxygen. Burning strontium in air results in a mixture of strontium oxide and strontium nitride. It also forms from the decomposition of strontium carbonate SrCO3. It is a strongly basic oxide.","images":[{"alt":"__ Sr2+     __ O2−","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/SrOpowder.jpg/200px-SrOpowder.jpg"},{"alt":"NaCl polyhedra.png","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NaCl_polyhedra.png/200px-NaCl_polyhedra.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Strontium_oxide","IUPAC name":"Strontium oxide","Other names":"Strontia","CAS Number":"1314-11-0 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.837","EC Number":"215-219-9","PubChem CID":"73975","Chemical formula":"SrO","Molar mass":"103.619 g/mol","Appearance":"colorless cubic crystals","Density":"4.70 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"2,531 °C (4,588 °F; 2,804 K)","Boiling point":"3,200 °C (5,790 °F; 3,470 K) (decomposes)","Solubility in water":"reacts, forms Sr(OH)2","Solubility":"miscible with potassium hydroxide\nslightly soluble in alcohol\ninsoluble in acetone and ether","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"−35.0·10−6 cm3/mol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.810 [2]","Crystal structure":"Halite (cubic), cF8","Space group":"Fm3m, No. 225","Coordination geometry":"Octahedral (Sr2+); octahedral (O2−)","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"44.3 J·mol−1·K−1","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"57.2 J·mol−1·K−1","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-592.0 kJ·mol−1","Flash point":"Non-flammable","Other anions":"Strontium sulfide","Other cations":"Beryllium oxide\nMagnesium oxide\nCalcium oxide\nBarium oxide","Related compounds":"Strontium hydroxide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
