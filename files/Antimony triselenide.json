{"name":"Antimony triselenide","desc":"Antimony triselenide is the chemical compound with the formula Sb2Se3. The material exists as the sulfosalt mineral antimonselite, which crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. In this compound, antimony has the oxidation state +3 and selenium −2, but in fact the bonding in this compound is highly covalent as reflected by the black color and semiconducting properties of this and related materials.","images":[{"alt":"Sb2Se3 structure.jpg","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Sb2Se3_structure.jpg/200px-Sb2Se3_structure.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Antimony(III)_selenide","Other names":"antimonselite\nselenoxyantimony","CAS Number":"1315-05-5 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"11483776 Y","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.870","PubChem CID":"6391662","Chemical formula":"Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>","Molar mass":"480.4 g/mol","Appearance":"black crystals","Density":"5.81 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, solid","Melting point":"611 °C (1,132 °F; 884 K)","Crystal structure":"Orthorhombic, oP20, SpaceGroup = Pnma, No. 62","NIOSH":"","PEL (Permissible)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[1]","REL (Recommended)":"TWA 0.5 mg/m3 (as Sb)[1]","Other anions":"antimony(III) oxide, antimony(III) sulfide, antimony(III) telluride","Other cations":"arsenic(III) selenide, bismuth(III) selenide","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
