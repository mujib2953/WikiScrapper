{"name":"Sodium aluminate","desc":"Sodium aluminate is an important commercial inorganic chemical. It works as an effective source of aluminium hydroxide for many industrial and technical applications. Pure sodium aluminate (anhydrous) is a white crystalline solid having a formula variously given as NaAlO2, NaAl(OH)4 (hydrated), Na2O·Al2O3, or Na2Al2O4. Commercial sodium aluminate is available as a solution or a solid.\nOther related compounds, sometimes called sodium aluminate, prepared by reaction of Na2O and Al2O3 are Na5AlO4 which contains discrete AlO45− anions, Na7Al3O8 and Na17Al5O16 which contain complex polymeric anions, and NaAl11O17, once mistakenly believed to be β-alumina, a phase of aluminium oxide.","images":[{"alt":"Sodium metaaluminate sample","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/NaAlO2.jpg/200px-NaAlO2.jpg"}],"link":"/wiki/Sodium_aluminate","Other names":"Sodium aluminium oxide,\nSodium metaaluminate\nAluminate, ((AlO2)1−), sodium","CAS Number":"1302-42-7 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ECHA InfoCard":"100.013.728","EC Number":"215-100-1","PubChem CID":"14766","Chemical formula":"NaAlO<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"81.97 g/mol","Appearance":"white powder (sometimes light-yellowish)\nhygroscopic/ when dissolved in water a colloidal black solution is formed","Odor":"odorless","Density":"1.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"1,650 °C (3,000 °F; 1,920 K)","Solubility in water":"soluble","Solubility":"soluble in alcohol","Refractive index (nD)":"1.566","Crystal structure":"orthorhombic","Specific\nheat capacity (C)":"73.6 J/mol K","Std molar\nentropy (So298)":"70.4 J/mol K","Std enthalpy of\nformation (ΔfHo298)":"-1133.2 kJ/mol","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
