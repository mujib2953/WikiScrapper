{"name":"Manganese(II) fluoride","desc":"Manganese(II) fluoride is the chemical compound composed of manganese and fluoride with the formula MnF2. It is a light pink crystalline solid, the light pink color being characteristic for manganese(II) compounds. It is made by treating manganese and diverse compounds of manganese(II) in hydrofluoric acid. It is used in the manufacture of special kinds of glass and lasers. It is a canonical example of uniaxial antiferromagnet (with Neel temperature of 68 K ) which has been experimentally studied since early on.","images":[{"alt":"Fluorid manganatý.PNG","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Fluorid_manganat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Fluorid_manganat%C3%BD.PNG"},{"alt":"","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Manganese(II)_fluoride","IUPAC name":"Manganese(II) fluoride","CAS Number":"7782-64-1 Y","3D model (JSmol)":"Interactive image","ChemSpider":"22935 N","ECHA InfoCard":"100.029.054","PubChem CID":"24528","RTECS number":"OP0875000","Chemical formula":"MnF<sub>2</sub>","Molar mass":"92.934855 g/mol","Appearance":"pale pink crystalline","Density":"3.98 g/cm<sup>3</sup>","Melting point":"856 °C (1,573 °F; 1,129 K)","Boiling point":"1,820 °C (3,310 °F; 2,090 K)","Magnetic susceptibility (χ)":"+10,700·10−6 cm3/mol","R-phrases (outdated)":"R20/21/22, R36/37/38","S-phrases (outdated)":"S26, S37/39[1]","Flash point":"non-flammable","Other anions":"Manganese(II) chloride\nManganese(II) bromide\nManganese(II) iodide","Other cations":"Technetium(VI) fluoride\nRhenium(VII) fluoride\nManganese(III) fluoride\nManganese(IV) fluoride","standard state":"Except where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa).\nExcept where otherwise noted, data are given for materials in their standard state (at 25 °C [77 °F], 100 kPa)."}
