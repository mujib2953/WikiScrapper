{"name":"Caffeine","desc":"Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.","images":[{"alt":"2D structure of caffeine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Caffeine_structure.svg/220px-Caffeine_structure.svg.png"},{"alt":"3D structure of caffeine","src":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Caffeine_%281%29_3D_ball.png/220px-Caffeine_%281%29_3D_ball.png"}],"link":"/wiki/Caffeine"}
